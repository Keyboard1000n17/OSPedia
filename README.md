SysPedia is a website that brings out the histories of notable operating systems of the past and present. It appreciates how far we've come with today's technology, how far we're going with technology, and how it's helped tremendously. It even provides a user interface matching the selected theme(PS: this sentence will be a reality in a few days as this is not my focus currently).

Subsites currently in development:
