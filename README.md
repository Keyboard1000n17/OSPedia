SysPedia - An encyclopedia of operating systems

I created this project in December of 2024 on a PC from 15 years ago with CMOS battery failure, so some of the files list 1/1/2004 as their creation date (I do work on a laptop now). I have worked endlessly on this website, but obviously I have schoolwork and chores to do as well. On my PC, I had to download Wikipedia pages and images on my phone and transfer them to the PC as I had no internet on my PC. The images I selected to set as the background on WinPedia pages, I made them dark with Photoshop 7.0. I also created the WinPedia and MacPedia logos with Adobe Illustrator 10.
