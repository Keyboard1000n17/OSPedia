# SysPedia - An encyclopedia of operating systems

SysPedia is a website that brings out the histories of notable operating systems of the past and present. It appreciates how far we've come with today's technology, how far we're going with technology, and how it's helped tremendously. It provides a user interface matching the selected theme(Note: this sentence will be a reality in a few months as this is not my focus currently).

Backstory (more like sob story ngl):

I created this project in December of 2024 on a PC from 15 years ago with CMOS battery failure, so some of the files list 1/1/2004 as their creation date (I do work on a laptop now). I have worked endlessly on this website, but obviously I have schoolwork and chores to do as well. On my PC, I had to download Wikipedia pages and images on my phone and transfer them to the PC as I had no internet on my PC. The images I selected to set as the background on WinPedia pages, I made them dark with Photoshop 7.0. I also created the WinPedia and MacPedia logos with Adobe Illustrator 10. I made this website to let people appreciate how far we have come in technology and so people can learn more about operating systems. Most information comes from Wikipedia by the way.
