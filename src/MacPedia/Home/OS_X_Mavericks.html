      OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) is the 10th major release of macOS, Apple
      Inc.'s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. OS X
      Mavericks was announced on June 10, 2013, at WWDC 2013, and was released
      on October 22, 2013, worldwide. It was also the last version to use a
      mostly skeuomorphic design; the next release, OS X Yosemite, featured a
      redesign of the user interface appearance. It was also the first version
      of macOS to be offered only on the App Store, rather than on a physical
      disk.
