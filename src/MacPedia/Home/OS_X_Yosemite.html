      OS X Yosemite was announced and released to developers on June 2, 2014, at
      WWDC 2014 and released to public beta testers on July 24, 2014. Yosemite
      was released to consumers on October 16, 2014. Following the Northern
      California landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks,
      Yosemite is named after the national park.

      <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        All Macintosh computers capable of running OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8.x)
        are able to run Yosemite as the two operating systems have the same
        requirements. However, to take full advantage of the Handoff feature,
        additional minimum system requirements include a Mac with Bluetooth LE
        (Bluetooth 4.0). As with Mavericks and Mountain Lion, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB
        of available storage, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 or later are
        required.
      </p>
      <p>These are the models that are compatible with OS X Yosemite:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Mid 2007 to Mid 2015)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Late 2008 to Mid 2010)</li>
        <li>12-inch MacBook (2015)</li>
        <li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 to Early 2015)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 to Mid 2015)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009 to Late 2014)</li>

        <li>Xserve (Early 2009)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are the models that support new features such as Handoff, Instant
        Hotspot as well as AirDrop between Mac computers and iOS devices:

        <p>
          Yosemite introduced a major overhaul of OS X's user interface,
          emphasizing flat graphic design over skeuomorphism, following the
          aesthetic introduced with iOS 7 and certain applications from OS X
          Mavericks. It is the first major redesign of the OS X user interface
          since 10.5 Leopard. Other changes include thinner fonts and blurred
          translucency effects. Some icons have been changed to correspond with
          those of iOS 7 and iOS 8. Yosemite maintains the OS X desktop
          metaphor.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes,
          and the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the
          default system typeface. Yosemite is the only macOS version to use
          Helvetica Neue as the default typeface, as in El Capitan it was again
          changed, this time to Apple's own, newly-designed San Francisco
          typeface. In Yosemite, the Dock is a 2D translucent rectangular strip
          instead of a skeuomorphic glass shelf, reminiscent of the Dock design
          used in early versions of OS X through Tiger and in iOS since iOS 7.

        <summary class="level-two">Continuity</summary>
        <p>
          Many of Yosemite's new features focus on the theme of "continuity",
          increasing its integration with other Apple platforms and services
          such as iOS and iCloud. The Handoff functionality allows the operating
          system to integrate with iOS 8 devices over Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi;
          users can place and answer phone calls using their iPhone as a
          conduit, send and receive text messages, activate personal hotspots,
          or load items being worked on in a mobile app (such as Mail drafts or
          Numbers spreadsheets) directly into their desktop equivalent.
