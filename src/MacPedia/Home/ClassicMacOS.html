    <p>
      Mac OS (originally System Software; retronym: Classic Mac OS) is the
      series of operating systems developed for the Macintosh family of personal
      computers by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1984 to 2001, starting with System
      1 and ending with Mac OS 9. The Macintosh operating system is credited
      with having popularized the graphical user interface concept. It was
      included with every Macintosh that was sold during the era in which it was
      developed, and many updates to the system software were done in
      conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh systems.

    <p>
      Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. The first
      version of the system software, which had no official name, was partially
      based on the Lisa OS, which Apple previously released for the Lisa
      computer in 1983. As part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in
      Apple at a favorable price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto
      computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members
      had previewed. This operating system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox
      ROM and the "System Folder", a set of files that were loaded from disk.
      The name Macintosh System Software came into use in 1987 with System 5.
      Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996, starting officially with
      version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh clone program. That program
      ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997. The last major release of the
      system was Mac OS 9 in 1999.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initial versions of the System Software ran one application at a time.
      With the Macintosh 512K, a system extension called the Switcher was
      developed to use this additional memory to allow multiple programs to
      remain loaded. The software of each loaded program used the memory
      exclusively; only when activated by the Switcher did the program appear,
      even the Finder's desktop. With the Switcher, the now familiar Clipboard
      feature allowed copy and paste between the loaded programs across switches
      including the desktop.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the introduction of System 5, a cooperative multitasking extension
      called MultiFinder was added, which allowed content in windows of each
      program to remain in a layered view over the desktop, and was later
      integrated into System 7 as part of the operating system along with
      support for virtual memory. By the mid-1990s, however, contemporary
      operating systems such as Windows NT, OS/2, NeXTSTEP, BSD, and Linux had
      all brought pre-emptive multitasking, protected memory, access controls,
      and multi-user capabilities to desktop computers. The Macintosh's limited
      memory management and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that
      provide additional functionality, such as networking or support for a
      particular device, led to significant criticism of the operating system,
      and was a factor in Apple's declining market share at the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      After two aborted attempts at creating a successor to the Macintosh System
      Software called Taligent and Copland, and a four-year development effort
      spearheaded by Steve Jobs's return to Apple in 1997, Apple replaced Mac OS
      with a new operating system in 2001 named Mac OS X. It retained most of
      the user interface design elements of the Classic Mac OS, and there was
      some overlap of application frameworks for compatibility, but the two
      operating systems otherwise have completely different origins and
      architectures.
    </p>

    <p>
      The final updates to Mac OS 9 released in 2001 provided interoperability
      with Mac OS X. The name "Classic" that now signifies the historical Mac OS
      as a whole is a reference to the Classic Environment, a compatibility
      layer that helped ease the transition to Mac OS X (now macOS).

      <summary class="level-one">Initial concept</summary>
      <p>
        The Macintosh project started in late 1978 with Jef Raskin, who
        envisioned an easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer.
        In September 1979, Raskin began looking for an engineer who could put
        together a prototype. Bill Atkinson, a member of the Apple Lisa team,
        introduced Raskin to Burrell Smith, a service technician who had been
        hired earlier that year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apple's concept for the Macintosh deliberately sought to minimize the
        user's awareness of the operating system. Many basic tasks that required
        more operating system knowledge on other systems could be accomplished
        by mouse gestures and graphic controls on a Macintosh. This would
        differentiate it from its contemporaries such as MS-DOS, which use a
        command-line interface consisting of terse, abbreviated textual
        commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        In January 1981, Steve Jobs completely took over the Macintosh project.
        Jobs and a number of Apple engineers visited Xerox PARC in December
        1979, three months after the Lisa and Macintosh projects had begun.
        After hearing about the pioneering GUI technology being developed at
        Xerox PARC from former Xerox employees like Raskin, Jobs negotiated a
        visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and Smalltalk development tools in
        exchange for Apple stock options. The final Lisa and Macintosh operating
        systems use concepts from the Xerox Alto, but many elements of the
        graphical user interface were created by Apple including the menu bar,
        pull-down menus, and the concepts of drag and drop and direct
        manipulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike the IBM PC, which uses 8 kB of system ROM for power-on self-test
        (POST) and basic input/output system (BIOS), the Mac ROM is
        significantly larger (64 kB) and holds key OS code. Much of the original
        Mac ROM code was written by Andy Hertzfeld, a member of the original
        Macintosh team. He was able to conserve precious ROM space by writing
        routines in assembly language code optimized with "hacks", or clever
        programming tricks. In addition to the ROM, he also coded the kernel,
        the Macintosh Toolbox, and some of the desktop accessories (DAs). The
        icons of the operating system, which represent folders and application
        software, were designed by Susan Kare, who later designed the icons for
        Microsoft Windows 3.0. Bruce Horn and Steve Capps wrote the Macintosh
        Finder, as well as a number of Macintosh system utilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apple aggressively advertised their new machine. After its release, the
        company bought all 39 pages of advertisement space in the 1984
        November/December edition of Newsweek magazine. The Macintosh quickly
        outsold its more sophisticated but much more expensive predecessor, the
        Lisa. Apple quickly developed MacWorks, a product that allowed the Lisa
        to emulate Macintosh system software through System 3, by which time it
        had been discontinued as the rebranded Macintosh XL. Many of the Lisa's
        operating system advances would not appear in the Macintosh operating
        system until System 7 or later.

      <div style="margin-left: 20px">
        <span class="level-two">Compatibility</span>
        <p>
          Early versions of Mac OS are compatible only with Motorola
          68000-family Macintoshes. As Apple introduced computers with PowerPC
          hardware, the OS was ported to support this architecture. Mac OS 8.1
          is the last version that could run on a 68k processor (the 68040).
        </p>

        <p>
          In systems prior to PowerPC G3-based systems, significant parts of the
          system are stored in physical ROM on the motherboard. The initial
          purpose of this is to avoid having the OS use up most of the 128KiB
          RAM of the initial Macintoshâ€”the initial ROMs were 64KiB. This
          architecture also allows for a completely graphical OS interface at
          the lowest level without the need for a text-only console or
          command-line mode: boot time errors, such as finding no functioning
          disk drives, are communicated to the user graphically, usually with an
          icon or the distinctive Chicago bitmap font and a Chime of Death or a
          series of beeps. This is in contrast to MS-DOS and CP/M computers of
          the time, which display such messages in a mono-spaced font on a black
          background, and require the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse,
          for input. To provide such niceties at a low level, early Mac OS
          depends on core system software in ROM on the motherboard, which also
          ensured that only Apple computers or licensed clones (with the
          copyright-protected ROMs from Apple) can run Mac OS.
        </p>

        <span class="level-two">File systems</span>
        <p>
          The Macintosh originally used the Macintosh File System (MFS), a flat
          file system with only one level of folders. This was quickly replaced
          in 1985 by the Hierarchical File System (HFS), which had a true
          directory tree. Both file systems are otherwise compatible. An
          improved file system named HFS Plus ("HFS+" or "Mac OS Extended") was
          announced in 1997 and implemented in 1998.
        </p>

        <p>
          Files in most file systems used with DOS, Windows, Unix, or other
          operating systems have only one "fork". By contrast, MFS and HFS give
          files two different "forks". The data fork contains the same sort of
          information as a file in other file systems, such as the text of a
          document or the bitmaps of an image file. The resource fork contains
          other structured data such as menu definitions, graphics, sounds, or
          code segments that would be incorporated into a program's file format
          on other systems. An executable file might consist only of resources
          (including code segments) with an empty data fork, while a data file
          might have only a data fork with no resource fork. A word processor
          file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information
          in the resource fork so that an application that does not recognize
          the styling information can still read the raw text.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, these forks would challenge interoperability with
          different operating systems. In copying or transferring a Mac OS file
          to a non-Mac system, the default implementations would strip the file
          of its resource fork. Most data files contained only nonessential
          information in their resource fork, such as window size and location,
          but program files would be inoperative without their resources. This
          necessitated such encoding schemes as BinHex and MacBinary, which
          allowed a user to encode a dual-forked file into a single stream, or
          inversely take a single stream so-encoded and reconstitute it into a
          dual-forked file usable by Mac OS.

          <p>
            As part of Apple's goal of creating a computer with appliance-like
            simplicity, there was no explicit distinction made between the
            operating system software and the hardware it runs on. Because of
            this, early versions of the operating system do not have a distinct
            name. The software consists of two user-visible files: the System
            file, and the Finder, an application used for file management that
            also displays the Desktop. The two files are contained in a folder
            directory labeled "System Folder", which contains other resource
            files, like a printer driver, needed to interact with the System.
            Version numbers of the operating system are based on the version
            numbers of these two files.

              System 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a flat file system named Macintosh
              File System (MFS). The Finder provides virtual folders that could
              be used to organize files, but these folders are not visible from
              any other application and do not exist on the disk.
            </li>
            <li>
              System 2.0 added support for AppleTalk and the newly introduced
              LaserWriter to use it.
            </li>
            <li>
              System 2.1 (Finder 5.0) introduced the Hierarchical File System
              (HFS) which has real directories. This version was specifically to
              support the Hard Disk 20 and only implements HFS in RAM; startup
              and most floppy disks remain MFS 400 K volumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              System 3.0 (Finder 5.1) was introduced with the Macintosh Plus,
              officially implementing HFS, 800K startup drives, support for
              several new technologies including SCSI and AppleShare, and Trash
              "bulging" (i.e., when the Trash contains files, it gains a bulged
              appearance).
            </li>
            <li>
              System 4.0 was released with the Macintosh SE and System 4.1 first
              shipped with the Macintosh IIâ€”these new machines required
              additional support for the first expansion slots, the Apple
              Desktop Bus (ADB), internal hard drives and, on the Macintosh II,
              external color displays and the first Motorola 68020 processor.
              System 4.0 was the first release to support color graphics;
              previous releases did not support color.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These releases can only run one application at a time, except for
            desk accessories, though special application shells such as
            Multi-Mac or Switcher (discussed under MultiFinder) could work
            around this. Visible changes are best reflected in the version
            number of the Finder, where major leaps are found between 1.x, 4.x,
            5.x, and 6.x.

          <summary class="level-two">System Software 5</summary>
          <p>
            Towards the end of 1987, Apple introduced a package titled "Apple
            Macintosh System Software Update 5.0". For the first time, the
            Macintosh operating system was offered as a distinct retail product
            that included four 800K disks and three manuals, at a cost of US$49.
            The software itself was still freely available through user groups
            and bulletin board services. While the product box presented this
            update to the operating system as "version 5.0", this number does
            not appear in the software itself. Three of the four disks (System
            Tools 1, System Tools 2 and Utilities 1) are all bootable, and the
            user can boot off whichever floppy contains the tools the user
            needs. For instance, System Tools 2 is the only disk with printer
            drivers, and Utilities 1 is the only disk with Disk First Aid and
            Apple HD SC Setup. Because the disks are named System Tools, users
            and the press commonly referred to this version as "System Tools
            5.0".
          </p>

          <p>
            The primary new feature of System 5 is MultiFinder, an extension
            that lets the system run several programs at once. The system uses a
            cooperative multitasking model, meaning that time is given to the
            background applications only when the foreground application yields
            control. A change in system functions that applications were already
            calling to handle events make many existing applications share time
            automatically, as well as being allowed to perform tasks in the
            background. Users can also choose not to use MultiFinder, thereby
            using a single application at a time. In 1990 InfoWorld tested four
            multitasking options for PC and Mac, viewing MultiFinder positively
            overall, but noting that its presence halved the speed of file
            transfer and printing compared to the single-tasking System 6
            without MultiFinder.

            System Software 6 (also referred to as "System 6") is a
            consolidation release of the Macintosh system software, producing a
            complete, stable, and long-lasting operating system. Two major
            hardware introductions requiring additional support under System 6
            are the 68030 processor and 1.44 MB SuperDrive debuting with the
            Macintosh IIx and Macintosh SE/30. Later updates include support for
            the first specialized laptop features with the introduction of the
            Macintosh Portable. From System 6 forward, the Finder has a unified
            version number closely matching that of the System, alleviating much
            of the confusion caused by the often considerable differences
            between earlier Systems.

          <p>
            On May 13, 1991, System 7 was released. It was a major upgrade over
            System 6, adding a significant user interface overhaul, new
            applications, stability improvements and many new features. Its
            introduction coincides with the release of and provided support for
            the 68040 Macintosh line. The System 7 era saw numerous changes in
            the Macintosh platform including a proliferation of Macintosh
            models, the 68k to Power Macintosh transition as well as the rise of
            Microsoft Windows, increasing use of computer networking and the
            explosion in the popularity of the Internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the most significant features of System 7 is virtual memory
            support, an essential subsystem anticipated for years, which only
            exists for previous Systems in a third party extension named Virtual
            from Connectix. Accompanying this was a move to 32-bit memory
            addressing, necessary for the ever-increasing amounts of RAM
            available to the Motorola 68030 CPU, and 68020 CPUs with a 68851
            PMMU. This process involves making all of the routines in OS code
            use the full 32-bits of a pointer as an addressâ€”prior systems used
            the upper 8 bits as flags. This change is known as being "32-bit
            clean". While System 7 itself is 32-bit clean, many existing
            machines and thousands of applications were not, so it was some time
            before the process was completed. To ease the transition, the
            "Memory" control panel contains a switch to disable this feature,
            allowing for compatibility with older applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another notable System 7 feature is built-in cooperative
            multitasking. In System Software 6, this function was optional
            through the MultiFinder. System 7 also introduced aliases, similar
            to symbolic links on Unix, shortcuts that were introduced in later
            versions of Microsoft Windows, and shadows in IBM OS/2. System
            extensions were enhanced by being moved to their own subfolder; a
            subfolder in the System Folder was also created for the control
            panels. In System 7.5, Apple includes the Extensions Manager, a
            previously third-party program which simplified the process of
            enabling and disabling extensions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Apple menu, home only to desk accessories in System 6, was made
            more general-purpose: the user could now make often-used folders and
            applicationsâ€”or anything else they desiredâ€”appear in the menu by
            placing aliases to them in an "Apple Menu Items" subfolder of the
            System Folder. System 7 also introduced the following: AppleScript,
            a scripting language for automating tasks; 32-bit QuickDraw,
            supporting so-called "true color" imaging, previously available as a
            system extension; and TrueType, an outline font standard.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Trash, under System 6 and earlier, empties itself automatically
            when shutting down the computerâ€”or, if MultiFinder is not running,
            when launching an application. System 7 reimplements the Trash as a
            special hidden folder, allowing files to remain in it across reboots
            until the user deliberately chose the "Empty Trash" command.

              <p>
                System 7.1 is mainly a bugfix release, with a few minor features
                added. One of the major new features of System 7.1 was moving
                fonts out of the System file into the Fonts folder in the System
                Folder. Previously a resource-copying utility such as ResEdit or
                Font D/A Mover was required for installing fonts. System 7.1 is
                not only the first Macintosh operating system to cost money (all
                previous versions were free or sold at the cost of the
                floppies), but also received a "Pro" sibling (version 7.1.1)
                with extra features. System 7.1.2 was the first version to
                support PowerPC-based Macs. System 7.1 also introduces the
                System Enablers as a method to support new models without
                updating the actual System file. This leads to extra files
                inside the system folder (one per new model supported).

              <p>
                System 7.5 introduces a large number of new features, many of
                which are based on shareware applications that Apple bought and
                included into the new system. On the newer PowerPC machines,
                System 7.5 may have stability problems partly due to a new
                memory manager (which can be turned off), and issues with the
                handling of errors in the PowerPC code (all PowerPC exceptions
                map to Type 11). These issues do not affect 68k-architecture
                machines. System 7.5 is contemporary with Apple's failed Copland
                effort as well as the release of Windows 95.

                Stability improved in PowerPC-based Macs with Mac OS 7.6, which
                dropped the "System" moniker as a more trademarkable name was
                needed in order to license the OS to the growing market of
                third-party Macintosh clone manufacturers. Mac OS 7.6 required
                32-bit-clean ROMs, and so it dropped support for every Mac with
                a 68000 processor, as well as the Mac II, Mac IIx, Mac IIcx, and
                Mac SE/30.

            Mac OS 8 was released on July 26, 1997, the same month Steve Jobs
            became the de facto CEO of Apple. It was mainly released to keep the
            Mac OS moving forward during a difficult time for Apple. Initially
            planned as Mac OS 7.7, it was renumbered "8" to exploit a legal
            loophole and accomplish Jobs's goal of terminating third-party
            manufacturers' licenses to System 7 and shutting down the Macintosh
            clone market.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mac OS 8 added a number of features from the abandoned Copland
            project, while leaving the underlying operating system unchanged. A
            multi-threaded Finder was included; files could now be copied in the
            background. The GUI was changed in appearance to a new shaded
            greyscale look named Platinum, and the ability to change the
            appearance themes (also known as skins) was added with a new control
            panel (though Platinum was the only one shipped). This capability
            was provided by a new "appearance" API layer within the OS, one of
            the few significant changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apple sold 1.2 million copies of Mac OS 8 in its first two weeks of
            availability and 3 million within six months. In light of Apple's
            financial difficulties at the time, there was a large grassroots
            movement among Mac users to upgrade and "help save Apple". Even some
            pirate groups refused to redistribute the OS.

                Mac OS 8.1 introduced an updated version of the Hierarchical
                File System named HFS+, which fixed many of the limitations of
                the earlier system and continued to be used in macOS up until
                macOS High Sierra, when it was replaced with the Apple File
                System. There are some other interface changes such as
                separating network features from printing, and some improvements
                to application switching. However, in underlying technical
                respects, Mac OS 8 is not very different from System 7.

          <p>
            Mac OS 9, the last major revision of the Classic Mac OS, was
            released on October 23, 1999. It is generally a steady evolution
            from Mac OS 8. Early development releases of Mac OS 9 were numbered
            8.7.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mac OS 9 added improved support for AirPort wireless networking. It
            introduced an early implementation of multi-user support. Though not
            a true multi-user operating system, Mac OS 9 does allow multiple
            desktop users to have their own data and system settings. An
            improved Sherlock search engine added several new search plug-ins.
            Mac OS 9 also provides a much improved memory implementation and
            management. AppleScript was improved to allow TCP/IP and networking
            control. Mac OS 9 also makes the first use of the centralized Apple
            Software Update to find and install OS and hardware updates.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other new features included its on-the-fly file encryption software
            with code signing and Keychain technologies, Remote Networking and
            File Server packages, and much improved list of USB drivers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mac OS 9 also added some transitional technologies to help
            application developers adopt some Mac OS X features before the
            introduction of the new OS to the public, to help ease the
            transition. These included new APIs for the file system and the
            bundling of the Carbon library that apps could link against instead
            of the traditional API librariesâ€”apps that were adapted to do this
            could be run natively on Mac OS X as well. Other changes were made
            beginning with the Mac OS 9.1 update to allow it to be launched in
            the Classic Environment within Mac OS X.

      <summary class="level-one">Transition to Mac OS X</summary>
      <p>
        macOS (originally "Mac OS X" and then "OS X") is Apple's current Mac
        operating system that officially succeeded the Classic Mac OS in 2001.
        Although it was originally marketed as simply "version 10" of Mac OS, it
        has a history that is largely independent of the earlier Mac OS
        releases.
      </p>

      <p>
        The macOS architectural legacy is the successor to Mac OS 9 and the
        Classic Mac OS legacy. However, unlike the Classic Mac OS, it is a
        Unix-based operating system built on NeXTSTEP and technology developed
        at NeXT from the late 1980s until early 1997, when Apple purchased the
        company, and its CEO Steve Jobs returned to Apple. macOS also makes use
        of the BSD codebase and the XNU kernel, and its core set of components
        is based upon Apple's open source Darwin operating system.
      </p>

      <p>
        An early version of the operating system, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was
        released in 1999. It retains the "Platinum" appearance from the Classic
        Mac OS and even resembles OPENSTEP in places, with the first version to
        arrive with the new Aqua user interface. The first consumer version, Mac
        OS X 10.0, was released on March 24, 2001, supporting the new Aqua user
        interface. Mac OS X was renamed "OS X" in 2011 and "macOS" in 2016.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users of the Classic Mac OS generally upgraded to Mac OS X, but it was
        criticized in its early years as more difficult and less user-friendly
        than the original Mac OS, for the lack of certain features that had not
        yet been reimplemented in the new OS, for being slower on the same
        hardware (especially older hardware), and for incompatibilities with the
        older OS. Because drivers (for printers, scanners, tablets, etc.)
        written for the older Mac OS were not compatible with Mac OS X,
        inconsistent program support with the Classic Environment program used
        to run the older operating system's programs on Mac OS X, and the lack
        of Mac OS X support for older Apple computers before late 1997; some
        Macintosh users continued using the older Classic Mac OS for a few years
        after the original release of Mac OS X. Steve Jobs encouraged people to
        upgrade to Mac OS X by staging a mock funeral for Mac OS 9 at WWDC 2002.
