    <p>
      OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8) is the ninth major release of macOS,
      Apple Inc.'s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers.
      OS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012, for purchase and
      download through the Mac App Store, as part of a switch to releasing OS X
      versions online and every year, rather than every two years. Named to
      signify its status as a refinement of the previous OS X version, Lion,
      Apple's stated aims in developing Mountain Lion were to allow users to
      more easily manage and synchronise content between multiple Apple devices
      and to make the operating system more familiar.

      <p>
        General availability: July 10, 2011 (version 10.7 build 11A511 -
        original Mac App Store release)
      </p>
      <p>

        build 11G56 and 11G63 respectively)
      </p>
      <p>Preceded by: Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6)</p>
      <p>Succeeded by: Mac OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8)</p>
      <p>Kernel type: Hybrid (XNU)</p>
      <p>Support status: Historical and no longer supported</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The operating system gained the new malware-blocking system Gatekeeper and
      integration with Apple's online Game Center and iCloud services, while the
      Safari web browser was updated to version 6. As on iOS, Notes and
      Reminders became full applications, separate from Mail and Calendar, while
      the iChat application was replaced with a version of iOS's Messages.
      Mountain Lion also added a version of iOS's Notification Center, which
      groups updates from different applications in one place. Integrated links
      allowing the user to rapidly transfer content to Twitter were present in
      the operating system from launch. Facebook integration was also planned
      but unfinished at launch date. It was released as a downloadable update
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      OS X Mountain Lion received positive reviews, with critics praising
      Notification Center, Messages, and speed improvements over OS X Lion,
      while criticizing iCloud for unreliability and Game Center for lack of
      games. Mountain Lion sold three million units in the first four days, and
      has sold 28 million units as of June 10, 2013, making it Apple's most
      popular OS X release. Mountain Lion was the last paid upgrade for an OS X
      major release, with OS X Mavericks and later being free. Apple later
      allowed free downloads of the OS, especially for customers of older and no
      longer officially supported Macintosh computers, starting on June 30,
      2021. The same practice was also applied to its predecessor, OS X Lion.

      <summary class="level-one">History</summary>
      <p>
        OS X Mountain Lion was officially announced by Apple on their website on
        February 16, 2012, as a successor to Mac OS X Lion. It achieved golden
        master status on July 9, 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 11,
        2012, Apple announced a "near final" release version of Mountain Lion
        for developers, with the public version arriving in July 2012 at a price
        tag of US$19.99 (€15.99 in Europe, £13.99 in the UK, $20.99 in Australia
        and ¥128 in Mainland China). The third generation MacBook Pro, revised
        MacBook Air, iPad Smart Case, and third-generation AirPort Express were
        announced at the keynote as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific release date of July 25 was not confirmed until the day
        before, July 24, by Apple CEO, Tim Cook, as part of Apple's 2012
        third-quarter earnings announcement. It was released to the Mac App
        Store on July 25, 2012, where it sold 3 million units in the first four
        days of release.
      </p>
      <p>
        An update for Mountain Lion, version 10.8.1, was released on August 23,
        2012. It resolved issues with iMessages, Migration Assistant, Safari,
        Microsoft Exchange Server, Mail, and many other applications. Tests of
        the update revealed that 10.8.1 also improved battery life on laptops,
        albeit gaining back only half of the battery life that was lost in
        updating to Mountain Lion. Although 10.8.1 improved battery life for
        some customers, others continue to complain about reduced battery life
        and a constant drop in battery health, ultimately resulting in a
        "Service Battery" message.

        <span class="level-two">Notification Center</span>
        <p>
          Notification Center was added in the operating system. It provides an
          overview of alerts from applications and displays notifications until
          the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant
          resolution. Users may choose what applications appear in Notification
          Center, and how they are handled. There are three types of
          notifications: banners, alerts, and badges. Banners are displayed for
          a short period of time in the upper right corner of the Mac's screen,
          and then slide off to the right. The icon of the application is
          displayed on the left side of the banner, while the message from the
          application will be displayed on the right side. Alerts are the same
          as banners, but will not disappear from the screen until the user
          takes action. Badges are red notification icons that are displayed on
          the application's icon. They indicate the number of items available
          for the application. It can be accessed by clicking the icon in the
          right corner of the menu bar. When open, the user can click a button
          to tweet, post status updates to Facebook, or view all notifications
          in the sidebar pane. Swiping up will reveal the option to disable
          Notification Center for one day. Many settings of Notification Center
          can be customized under the "Notifications" pane in System
          Preferences. Each application can have three ways to display
          notifications: none, banners, and alerts. Options to toggle the app
          icons and sounds are also available. Users can click and drag an app
          in the pane to change the order the applications are displayed within
          Notification Center.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <span class="level-two">Notes</span>
        <p>
          Notes, another transfer from iOS, is added. It is separate from Mail
          in its own application, with support for desktop notes added (syncs
          along with its iOS counterpart) Created notes are synced through all
          the user's Apple devices through the iCloud service. Notes can be
          arranged in folders, and pinned to the user's desktop. When the
          application is closed, the pinned note still remains. Notes can be
          created in three different default fonts - Noteworthy, Marker Felt,
          and Helvetica. Users can add custom fonts by visiting the Show Fonts
          menu. The menu allows users to change text size, format lists, choose
          the alignment (left, center, justify, or right), assign a writing
          direction, and indent text. Attachments, images, and hyperlinks can
          also be added into a note. Attachments cannot be viewed on iOS
          devices.

      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Messages</summary>
        <p>
          Messages, an instant messaging software application, is added in
          Mountain Lion. It was announced on February 16, 2012, as part of the
          OS X Mountain Lion developer preview. Starting with this release,
          Messages replaced iChat as the default OS X instant-messaging client.
          A free beta version of Messages was available to download for Mac OS X
          Lion from the Apple website until June 2012. The final version of
          Messages was included with the release version of OS X Mountain Lion.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with its predecessor, Messages has text messaging, audio, and
          screen-sharing capabilities. Messages also contains native video
          conversation support, utilizing Apple's FaceTime video calling
          application where possible. However, it does retain video capabilities
          for interfacing with other instant messaging clients. Messages
          supports Apple's iMessage, a free instant messaging service previously
          only available on devices running iOS 5. It also supports both
          Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) (shown in the
          application under its former name, Jabber) and the AOL Instant
          Messenger (AIM) OSCAR protocol. It also offers a direct connection to
          Yahoo! Messenger and Google Talk.

        <summary class="level-two">Game Center</summary>
        <p>
          The Game Center application from iOS was added in OS X Mountain Lion.
          It is an online multiplayer social-gaming network, and allows users to
          invite friends to play a game, start a multiplayer game through
          matchmaking, track their achievements, and compare their high scores
          on a leader board. Points are awarded to players as a part of Game
          Center's achievement tracking system. Players can earn points by
          meeting specific in-game challenges. A player must establish an Apple
          ID to associate with a Game Center nickname. A player has the option
          to create an Apple ID from within Game Center if they do not already
          have one. Only one nickname may be associated with an Apple ID at any
          given time. Each player is assigned a profile in Game Center. A
          profile consists of the player's nickname, the number of Game
          Center-compatible games the player owns, the number of friends the
          player has, the number of achievement points a player has, and an
          optional photo and player-defined status.

      <details>
        <summary class="level-two">Application updates</summary>
        <p>
          OS X Mountain Lion added updates for many applications on the
          operating system. The Chess app supports Game Center. Dashboard
          widgets can be managed in a UI similar to Launchpad. Mail adds new VIP
          feature to save frequent contacts. The Preview app gets an improved
          user interface. It is able to fill out forms in PDF documents that
          don't contain actual PDF form fields. Reminders is a new to-do list
          application, separate from Calendar in its own application that syncs
          along with its iOS counterpart. Safari 6 gets a new release and
          features a new address bar; a combination of the address bar and the
          search field. The address bar also has a "Reader" button, showing the
          user just the text of the article without advertisements and
          distraction. When the user is on a website with no article, the button
          is disabled. Safari 6 is available as a download for OS X Lion. Time
          Machine is able to do rotating backups on more than one storage
          medium.

        <summary class="level-two">Other updates</summary>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mirroring is added, which allows wireless mirroring of a Mac's
            screen to an Apple TV. System-wide integration of AirPlay audio
            transmission is added. There are many new features for Chinese
            users, including support for Baidu as an option for Safari search
            engine, QQ, 163.com and 126.com services for Mail, Contacts and
            Calendar, Youku, Tudou and Sina Weibo are integrated into share
            sheets. Dictation, new in Mountain Lion, is a system-wide voice
            input mechanism that requires a broadband Internet connection.
            Facebook gained full integration following an update in late 2012.
            Some of the features include single-sign on and integration in
            Notification Center, Contacts and Share Sheets. Gatekeeper, also new
            to Mountain Lion, is an anti-malware feature based on digital
            signatures and the Mac App Store.

            Power Nap allows flash storage-based Macintoshes (late 2010 MacBook
            Air and later, or the MacBook Pro with Retina display) to
            synchronize with iCloud (Reminders, Calendars, Photo Stream, Notes,
            Mail, and Find My Mac) while sleeping and also allows a Mac to
            download App Store and OS X updates as well as make periodic Time
            Machine backups when it is plugged in and sleeping. Several new
            screensavers were added. Share Sheets, a "Share" button and dialog
            box in Safari and other applications, are added. Twitter was
            integrated with almost all of the applications, with single-sign on,
            tweeting from an app, Tweet Sheets, tweeting photos and links, using
            multiple Twitter accounts, Twitter notifications, profile picture
            integration, and Location Services available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Application updates automatically install from the Mac App Store.
            The iCloud library User interface (UI) was integrated throughout the
            operating systems, which includes new Open and Save dialog boxes
            across built-in applications, iWork and third-party applications via
            an Application programming interface (API). Applications that make
            use of this API support a new user interface to view and manage
            documents in the cloud that are specific to the application being
            used. Documents can be renamed from the title bar. iWork documents
            automatically synchronize with iCloud. The full screen ability is on
            every display.
          </li>
          <li>
            The operating system gained the new malware-blocking system
            Gatekeeper and integration with Apple's online Game Center and
            iCloud services, while the Safari web browser was updated to version
            6. As on iOS, Notes and Reminders became full applications, separate
            from Mail and Calendar, while the iChat application was replaced
            with a version of iOS's Messages. Mountain Lion also added a version
            of iOS's Notification Center, which groups updates from different
            applications in one place. Integrated links allowing the user to
            rapidly transfer content to Twitter were present in the operating
            system from launch. Facebook integration was also planned but
            unfinished at launch date. It was released as a downloadable update
            later.

            The Dock has received an updated look, emulating the appearance of
            the aluminum surface that much of Apple's current hardware line-up
            sports. Scroll bars widen when the mouse hovers over them. Finder
            displays a progress bar in the "size" column when copying a file,
            and on icons in Launchpad when downloading from the Mac App Store.
            Launchpad has Spotlight search for finding applications. Address
            Book was renamed "Contacts", and iCal was renamed "Calendar".
