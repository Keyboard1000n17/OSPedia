    <p>
      OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8) is the ninth major release of macOS,
      Apple Inc.'s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers.
      OS X Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012, for purchase and
      download through the Mac App Store, as part of a switch to releasing OS X
      versions online and every year, rather than every two years. Named to
      signify its status as a refinement of the previous OS X version, Lion,
      Apple's stated aims in developing Mountain Lion were to allow users to
      more easily manage and synchronise content between multiple Apple devices
      and to make the operating system more familiar.

      <p>
        Last release: September 19, 2012 and October 4, 2012 (version 10.7.5.
        build 11G56 and 11G63 respectively)
      </p>

      <p>Succeeded by: Mac OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8)</p>

      <p>Support status: Historical and no longer supported</p>

    <p>
      The operating system gained the new malware-blocking system Gatekeeper and
      integration with Apple's online Game Center and iCloud services, while the
      Safari web browser was updated to version 6. As on iOS, Notes and
      Reminders became full applications, separate from Mail and Calendar, while
      the iChat application was replaced with a version of iOS's Messages.
      Mountain Lion also added a version of iOS's Notification Center, which
      groups updates from different applications in one place. Integrated links
      allowing the user to rapidly transfer content to Twitter were present in
      the operating system from launch. Facebook integration was also planned
      but unfinished at launch date. It was released as a downloadable update
      later.
    </p>
    <p>
      OS X Mountain Lion received positive reviews, with critics praising
      Notification Center, Messages, and speed improvements over OS X Lion,
      while criticizing iCloud for unreliability and Game Center for lack of
      games. Mountain Lion sold three million units in the first four days, and
      has sold 28 million units as of June 10, 2013, making it Apple's most
      popular OS X release. Mountain Lion was the last paid upgrade for an OS X
      major release, with OS X Mavericks and later being free. Apple later
      allowed free downloads of the OS, especially for customers of older and no
      longer officially supported Macintosh computers, starting on June 30,
      2021. The same practice was also applied to its predecessor, OS X Lion.

      <summary class="level-one">History</summary>
      <p>
        OS X Mountain Lion was officially announced by Apple on their website on
        February 16, 2012, as a successor to Mac OS X Lion. It achieved golden
        master status on July 9, 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 11,
        2012, Apple announced a "near final" release version of Mountain Lion
        for developers, with the public version arriving in July 2012 at a price
        tag of US$19.99 (€15.99 in Europe, £13.99 in the UK, $20.99 in Australia
        and ¥128 in Mainland China). The third generation MacBook Pro, revised
        MacBook Air, iPad Smart Case, and third-generation AirPort Express were
        announced at the keynote as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific release date of July 25 was not confirmed until the day
        before, July 24, by Apple CEO, Tim Cook, as part of Apple's 2012
        third-quarter earnings announcement. It was released to the Mac App
        Store on July 25, 2012, where it sold 3 million units in the first four
        days of release.
      </p>
      <p>
        An update for Mountain Lion, version 10.8.1, was released on August 23,
        2012. It resolved issues with iMessages, Migration Assistant, Safari,
        Microsoft Exchange Server, Mail, and many other applications. Tests of
        the update revealed that 10.8.1 also improved battery life on laptops,
        albeit gaining back only half of the battery life that was lost in
        updating to Mountain Lion. Although 10.8.1 improved battery life for
        some customers, others continue to complain about reduced battery life
        and a constant drop in battery health, ultimately resulting in a
        "Service Battery" message.

      <summary class="level-one">New and changed features</summary>
      <span class="level-two">Notification Center</span>
      <p>
        Notification Center was added in the operating system. It provides an
        overview of alerts from applications and displays notifications until
        the user completes an associated action, rather than requiring instant
        resolution. Users may choose what applications appear in Notification
        Center, and how they are handled. There are three types of
        notifications: banners, alerts, and badges. Banners are displayed for a
        short period of time in the upper right corner of the Mac's screen, and
        then slide off to the right. The icon of the application is displayed on
        the left side of the banner, while the message from the application will
        be displayed on the right side. Alerts are the same as banners, but will
        not disappear from the screen until the user takes action. Badges are
        red notification icons that are displayed on the application's icon.
        They indicate the number of items available for the application. It can
        be accessed by clicking the icon in the right corner of the menu bar.
        When open, the user can click a button to tweet, post status updates to
        Facebook, or view all notifications in the sidebar pane. Swiping up will
        reveal the option to disable Notification Center for one day. Many
        settings of Notification Center can be customized under the
        "Notifications" pane in System Preferences. Each application can have
        three ways to display notifications: none, banners, and alerts. Options
        to toggle the app icons and sounds are also available. Users can click
        and drag an app in the pane to change the order the applications are
        displayed within Notification Center.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two">Notes</span>
      <p>
        Notes, another transfer from iOS, is added. It is separate from Mail in
        its own application, with support for desktop notes added (syncs along
        with its iOS counterpart) Created notes are synced through all the
        user's Apple devices through the iCloud service. Notes can be arranged
        in folders, and pinned to the user's desktop. When the application is
        closed, the pinned note still remains. Notes can be created in three
        different default fonts - Noteworthy, Marker Felt, and Helvetica. Users
        can add custom fonts by visiting the Show Fonts menu. The menu allows
        users to change text size, format lists, choose the alignment (left,
        center, justify, or right), assign a writing direction, and indent text.
        Attachments, images, and hyperlinks can also be added into a note.
        Attachments cannot be viewed on iOS devices.
