    <p>
      Mac OS X 10.1 (code named Puma) is the second major release of macOS,
      Apple's desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.0
      and preceded Mac OS X Jaguar. Mac OS X 10.1 was released on September 25,
      2001, as a free update for Mac OS X 10.0 users. The operating system was
      handed out for free by Apple employees after Steve Jobs' keynote speech at
      the Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco. It was subsequently
      distributed to Mac users on October 25, 2001, at Apple Stores and other
      retail stores that carried Apple products.

      <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
      <p>
        Apple introduced many features that were missing from the previous
        version, as well as improving overall system performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        This system release brought some major new features to the Mac OS X
        platform:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Performance enhancements — Mac OS X 10.1 introduced large performance
          increases throughout the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Easier CD and DVD burning — better support in Finder as well as in
          iTunes
        </li>
        <li>DVD playback support — DVDs can be played in Apple DVD Player</li>
        <li>
          More printer support (200 printers supported out of the box) — One of
          the main complaints of version 10.0 users was the lack of printer
          drivers, and Apple attempted to remedy the situation by including more
          drivers, although many critics complained that there were still not
          enough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Faster 3D (OpenGL performs 20% faster) — The OpenGL drivers and
          handling were vastly improved in this version of Mac OS X, which
          created a large performance gap for 3D elements in the interface, and
          3D applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved AppleScript — The scripting interface now allows scripting
          access to many more system components, such as the Printer Center, and
          Terminal, thus improving the customizability of the interface. As
          well, Apple introduced AppleScript Studio, which allows a user to
          create full AppleScript applications in a simple graphical interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved filehandling - The Finder was enhanced to optionally hide
          file extensions on a per-file basis. The Cocoa API was enhanced to
          allow developers to set traditional Mac type and creator information
          directly without relying on Carbon to do it.
        </li>
        <li>ColorSync 4.0, the color management system and API.</li>
        <li>
          Image Capture, for acquiring images from digital cameras and scanners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Menu Extras, a set of items the user can add to the system menu,
          replacing the supplied Dock
        </li>
        Extras from Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah.
        <li>
          Apple switched to using Mac OS X as the default on all then-new Macs
          with the 10.1.2 release.
        </li>
      </ul>
