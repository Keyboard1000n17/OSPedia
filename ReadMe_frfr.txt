Yo,
Don't mind the remains of the -History suffix naming, I'm trying to get MacPedia done and don't wanna waste time on the other stuff. There is only one What'sNew.txt file which is located in the WinPedia folder. Oh yeah, and my PC lags while displaying the MacPedia homepage (my 5K and 6K wallpapers for macOS were compressed - the .zip file was 25.5 MB and WinPedia archive version 1.33 that you have been provided is 9.something MB and version 1.32 was 16.9 MB for some reason idk why).
