  <p>
    Windows 3.1 is a major release of Microsoft Windows. It was released to
    manufacturing on April 6, 1992, as a successor to Windows 3.0. Like its
    predecessors, the Windows 3.1 series run as a shell on top of MS-DOS; it was
    the last Windows 16-bit operating environment as all future versions of
    Windows had moved to 32-bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The TrueType font system was introduced in Windows 3.1 as a competitor to
    Adobe Type Manager. Its multimedia was also expanded, and screensavers were
    introduced, alongside new software such as Windows Media Player and Sound
    Recorder. File Manager and Control Panel received tweaks, and Windows 3.1
    saw the introduction of the Windows Registry and add-ons. It could even
    utilize more memory than its predecessors.

    Microsoft also released special versions of Windows 3.1 throughout 1992 and
    1993; in Europe and Japan, Windows 3.1 was introduced with more language
    support. In November 1993, Windows 3.11 was released as a minor update,
    while Windows 3.2 was released as a Simplified Chinese version of Windows
    3.1. Microsoft also introduced Windows for Workgroups, the first version of
    Windows to allow integrated networking. Mostly oriented towards businesses,
    it received network improvements and it allowed users to share files, use
    print servers, and chat online, while it also introduced peer-to-peer
    networking.
  </p>

  <p>
    The series is considered to be an improvement on its predecessors. It was
    praised for its reinvigoration of the user interface and technical design.
    Windows 3.1 sold over three million copies during the first three months of
    its release, although its counterpart Windows for Workgroups was noted as a
    "business disappointment" due to its small amount of sold copies. It was
    succeeded by Windows 95, and Microsoft ended the support for Windows 3.1
    series on December 31, 2001, except for the embedded version, which was
    retired in 2008.

    <summary class="level-one">Development History</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 3.0, the predecessor of 3.1, was released in 1990, and is
      considered to be the first version of Windows to receive critical acclaim.
      Windows 3.0 received around 10 million sales before the release of Windows
      3.1 on April 6, 1992. Microsoft began a television advertising campaign
      for the first time on March 1, 1992. The advertisements, developed by
      Ogilvy & Mather, were designed to introduce a broader audience to Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows 3.1 was codenamed Janus. Like its predecessors, the operating
      environment runs as a shell on top of MS-DOS, although it does not include
      the MS-DOS Executive shell. After the introduction of Windows 1.0,
      Microsoft had worked on gaining support from companies to expand its
      operating environment on different types of PCs. Tandy Corporation was
      open to shipping Tandy Sensation PCs with the Windows 3.1 operating
      environment. IBM and its PCs were also provided with Windows 3.1.

      Further enhancements were introduced in Windows 3.1. The TrueType font
      system was introduced to provide scalable fonts to Windows applications,
      without having to resort on using third-party technology such as Adobe
      Type Manager (ATM). Windows 3.1 introduced Arial, Courier New, and Times
      New Roman fonts, in regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic versions, which
      could be scaled to any size and rotated, depending on the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      To improve user interaction, Microsoft initiated warning and event sounds,
      and introduced computer command shortcuts for copy, cut, and paste.
      Windows 3.1 is also noted for its improvement of multimedia; screensavers,
      Windows Media Player, and Sound Recorder were introduced into the
      operating environment. These features were already present on the Windows
      3.0 with Multimedia Extensions version, although they were only available
      to users with newly bought PCs. The Media Player could play MIDI music
      files and AVI video files, while the Sound Recorder could play, record,
      and edit sound files that were affiliated with the WAV format. 
      Minesweeper was officially introduced in Windows 3.1 as a replacement for
      Reversi, alongside Solitaire. MS-DOS programs were previously not able to
      be controlled with a mouse; this ended up being introduced in Windows 3.1.
      Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) was added to allow drag-and-drop
      embedding of images and formatted text between Windows programs. SVGA
      color support was also introduced in this version.
    </p>
    <p>
      File Manager had also received tweaks; split view-mode was introduced,
      users were now able to browse files without having to open separate
      windows, while files were able to be dragged and dropped to other
      locations on the system. An option for quick formatting was introduced to
      format floppy disks and copy its files without having to quit Windows.
      File Manager is an MDI application that is used for moving, deleting, and
      managing files on the system. Microsoft also built Microsoft Bob, a
      utility that would act as a search assistant, on Windows 3.1, only for it
      to be released on Windows 95 in 1995. The introduction of Windows
      Registry, a centralized database that could store configuration
      information and settings for various operating systems components and
      applications, also occurred in this version. The Control Panel also
      received changes; its items were now hard-coded, and additional items
      could be added by placing additional .cpl files. Similarly, the Calendar
      uses the .cal extension. Printer management tasks were moved over to
      Control Panel and Print Manager. Several printer drivers were improved in
      Windows 3.1, making the Print Manager more efficient to use.  Windows 3.1
      also includes troubleshooting and diagnostic tools such as the Dr. Watson
      utility which saves information about application errors, and Microsoft
      Diagnostics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows 3.1 also includes add-ons; Video for Windows was introduced in
      November 1992 as a reaction to Apple's QuickTime technology. At the price
      of $200, the software included editing and encoding programs. It was later
      built into Windows 95. Microsoft also published Windows for Pen Computing,
      a pen computing interface which was created in response to PenPoint OS by
      GO Corporation. The operating environment was also given limited
      compatibility with the then-new 32-bit Windows API, by introducing Win32s,
      an enabling technology. Microsoft also provided WinG, an application
      program interface, to entice developers to move from DOS to Windows. It
      also provided a device-independent interface to graphics and printer
      hardware, and allowed programs to have both read and write capabilities to
      the WinGDC.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike all previous versions, Windows 3.1 could not run in real mode and
      it insisted on the use of 80286 processors or above. Because of this, the
      maximum memory available was increased. While Windows 3.0 was limited to
      16 MB maximum memory, Windows 3.1 could access a theoretical 4 GB in the
      386 enhanced mode. The actual practical ceiling is 256 MB. Like its
      predecessors, it runs as a 16-bit system; Windows 3.1 is also the last
      Windows to run in 16-bit mode. It is also the first Windows to be
      distributed on a CD-ROM. The setup interface was simplified; express mode
      was introduced to automatically set up Windows. Windows 3.1 also includes
      an online tutorial applet for users regarding the use of the Windows 3.1
      user interface. In addition it supported the Advanced Power Management
      standard.

      the Simplified Chinese language. A font editor is present in Windows 3.2;
      it is used to add new Chinese characters to the already-existing fonts.
    </p>

    <span class="bolden">Windows for Workgroups</span>
    <p>
      Windows for Workgroups served as an update to Windows 3.1, and it was the
      first version of Windows that was suitable for integrated networking.
      Initially developed as an add-on for Windows 3.0, it was later released in
      1992. It introduced drivers and protocols for peer-to-peer networking.

          share files, use print servers, and chat online; files could be
          accessed from other machines that run either Windows or DOS. The
          Microsoft Hearts card game was also added, while Object Linking and
          Embedding, which was implemented in Windows 3.1, was also included in
          the Windows for Workgroups version. The Workgroups version also
          introduced the Microsoft Mail program, which allowed users to receive
          and send emails, and Microsoft Schedule+, a time management app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Windows for Workgroups could also be accessed from an OS/2 client that
          uses the Server Message Block (SMB), a protocol used for sharing files
          and printers over local networks. It introduced support for the
          NetBEUI protocol. The price sat at $69 for Windows 3.1 users.

        <p>
          It received network improvements; a Winsock package was released for
          Windows for Workgroups, although it was later replaced by a 32-bit
          stack add-on package (codenamed Wolverine) that provided TCP/IP
          support in Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Its connectivity with NetWare
          networks was increased, while it also introduced support for Open
          Data-Link Interface cards and Internetwork Packet Exchange drivers.

    <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 3.1 changed some icons, of which the most notable change is the
      addition of color to icons. Some icons changed include the ones for File
      Manager, Control Panel, Paint, Notepad and Calculator.<!--  Generated by Gemini -->
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows 3.1 introduced TrueType font support, therefore making fonts
      clearer at any size. They were vector fonts, which meant that they used
      mathematical equations to define the size of every letter, so they could
      be scaled to any size without losing quality. Before TrueType fonts,
      bitmap fonts were used which were made on a grid of pixels, causing them
      to become jagged and / or pixelated on increasing their size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many features from the Mutimedia Extensions pack for Windows 3.0 were
      integrated into Windows 3.1. One of those programs was Media Player, which
      could play WAV and MIDI audio files and AVI video files. Sound Recorder
      was also added, allowing users to record and edit audio files.
