    Windows XP is a major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating systems.
    It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and later to retail on
    October 25, 2001. It is a direct successor to Windows 2000 for high-end and
    business users and Windows Me for home users.

  <p>
    Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s under the codename
    "Neptune", built on the Windows NT kernel and explicitly intended for
    mainstream consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000, codenamed
    "Odyssey", was also initially planned for the business market. However, in
    January 2000, both Windows Odyssey and Neptune were scrapped and replaced by
    a single unified operating system codenamed "Whistler" based on the Windows
    NT kernel, which would serve both home consumers and buisness markets. Thsi
    occured as they realized that both were going to based on the same Windows
    2000 codebase. Therefore, Windows XP is the first consumer edition of
    Windows which is not based on the Windows 95 kernel or MS-DOS. Windows XP
    removed support for PC-98, i486, and SGI Visual Workstation 320 and 540
    architecture, and only runs on 32-bit x86 CPUs and devices that use BIOS
    firmware.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased
    performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a new,
    visually appealing user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded
    multimedia capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded
    by Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008,
    respectively. Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and
    extended support ended on April 8, 2014. Windows Embedded POSReady 2009,
    based on Windows XP Professional, received security updates until April
    2019. The final security update for Service Pack 3 was released on May 14,
    2019. Unofficial methods were made available to apply the updates to other
    editions of Windows XP, which Microsoft has discouraged, citing
    compatibility issues.
  </p>

    <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
    <p>
      In the late 1990s, initial development of what would become Windows XP was
      focused on two individual products: "Odyssey", which was reportedly
      intended to succeed the future Windows 2000 and "Neptune", which was
      reportedly a consumer-oriented operating system using the Windows NT
      architecture, succeeding the MS-DOS-based Windows 98.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the projects proved to be too ambitious. In January 2000, shortly
      prior to the official release of Windows 2000, technology writer Paul
      Thurrott reported that Microsoft had shelved both Neptune and Odyssey in
      favor of a new product codenamed "Whistler", named after Whistler, British
      Columbia, as many Microsoft employees skied at the Whistler-Blackcomb ski
      resort. The goal of Whistler was to unify both the consumer and
      business-oriented Windows lines under a single, Windows NT platform.
      Thurrott stated that Neptune had become "a black hole when all the
      features that were cut from Windows Me were simply re-tagged as Neptune
      features. And since Neptune and Odyssey would be based on the same
      code-base anyway, it made sense to combine them into a single project".
    </p>
    <p>
      At PDC on July 13, 2000, Microsoft announced that Whistler would be
      released during the second half of 2001, and also unveiled the first
      preview build, 2250, which featured an early implementation of Windows
      XP's visual styles system and interface changes to Windows Explorer and
      the Control Panel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Microsoft released the first public beta build of Whistler, build 2296, on
      October 31, 2000. Subsequent builds gradually introduced features that
      users of the release version of Windows XP would recognize, such as
      Internet Explorer 6.0, the Microsoft Product Activation system, and the
      Bliss desktop background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whistler was officially unveiled during a media event on February 5, 2001,
      under the name Windows XP, where XP stands for "eXPerience".
    </p>
    <p>
      In June 2001, Microsoft indicated that it was planning to spend at least
      US$1 billion on marketing and promoting Windows XP, in conjunction with
      Intel and other PC makers. The theme of the campaign, "Yes You Can", was
      designed to emphasize the platform's overall capabilities. Microsoft had
      originally planned to use the slogan "Prepare to Fly", but it was replaced
      because of sensitivity issues in the wake of the September 11 attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 24, 2001, Windows XP build 2600 was released to manufacturing
      (RTM). During a ceremonial media event at Microsoft Redmond Campus, copies
      of the RTM build were given to representatives of several major PC
      manufacturers in briefcases, who then flew off on decorated helicopters.
      While PC manufacturers would be able to release devices running XP
      beginning on September 24, 2001, XP was expected to reach general retail
      availability on October 25, 2001. On the same day, Microsoft also
      announced the final retail pricing of XP's two main editions, "Home" (as a
      replacement for Windows Me for home computing) and "Professional" (as a
      replacement for Windows 2000 for high-end users).
    </p>

    <span class="level-two">Service packs</span>
    <p>
      A service pack is a cumulative update package that is a superset of all
      updates, and even service packs, that have been released before it. Three
      service packs have been released for Windows XP. Service Pack 3 is
      slightly different, as it needs at least Service Pack 1 to have been
      installed, in order to update a live OS. However, Service Pack 3 can still
      be embedded into a Windows installation disc where SP1 is not reported as
      a prerequisite for doing so.
    </p>

    <p>
      The boot screens for all editions of Windows XP have been unified by
      Service Pack 2 for Windows XP with a new one that no longer displays the
      SKU, with the boot screen for Home Edition using a blue progress bar
      instead of green. The copyright years on the boot screen were also
      removed.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-three">Service Pack 1</summary>
      <p>
        Service Pack 1 (SP1) for Windows XP was released on September 9, 2002.
        It contained over 300 minor, post-RTM bug fixes, along with all security
        patches released since the original release of XP. SP1 also added USB
        2.0 support, the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine, .NET Framework support,
        and support for technologies used by the then-upcoming Media Center and
        Tablet PC editions of XP. The most significant change on SP1 was the
        addition of Set Program Access and Defaults, a settings page which
        allows programs to be set as default for certain types of activities
        (such as media players or web browsers) and for access to bundled,
        Microsoft programs (such as Internet Explorer or Windows Media Player)
        to be disabled. This feature was added to comply with the settlement of
        United States v. Microsoft Corp., which required Microsoft to offer the
        ability for OEMs to bundle third-party competitors to software it
        bundles with Windows (such as Internet Explorer and Windows Media
        Player), and give them the same level of prominence as those normally
        bundled with the OS.
      </p>

      <p>
        On February 3, 2003, Microsoft released Service Pack 1a (SP1a). It was
        the same as SP1, except the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine was excluded.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-three">Service Pack 2</summary>
      <p>
        Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Windows XP Home edition and Professional
        edition was released on August 25, 2004. Headline features included WPA
        encryption compatibility for Wi-Fi and usability improvements to the
        Wi-Fi networking user interface, partial Bluetooth support, and various
        improvements to security systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Headed by former computer hacker Window Snyder, the service pack's
        security improvements (codenamed "Springboard", as these features were
        intended to underpin additional changes in Longhorn) included a major
        revision to the included firewall (renamed Windows Firewall, and now
        enabled by default), and an update to Data Execution Prevention, which
        gained hardware support in the NX bit that can stop some forms of buffer
        overflow attacks. Raw socket support is removed (which supposedly limits
        the damage done by zombie machines) and the Windows Messenger service
        (which had been abused to cause pop-up advertisements to be displayed as
        system messages without a web browser or any additional software) became
        disabled by default. Additionally, security-related improvements were
        made to e-mail and web browsing. Service Pack 2 also added Security
        Center, an interface that provides a general overview of the system's
        security status, including the state of the firewall and automatic
        updates. Third-party firewall and antivirus software can also be
        monitored from Security Center.
      </p>

      <p>
        In August 2006, Microsoft released updated installation media for
        Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 SP2 (SP2b), in order to incorporate a
        patch requiring ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer to be manually
        activated before a user may interact with them. This was done so that
        the browser would not violate a patent owned by Eolas. Microsoft has
        since licensed the patent, and released a patch reverting the change in
        April 2008. In September 2007, another minor revision known as SP2c was
        released for XP Professional, extending the number of available product
        keys for the operating system to "support the continued availability of
        Windows XP Professional through the scheduled system builder channel
        end-of-life (EOL) date of January 31, 2009."
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-three">Service Pack 3</summary>
      <p>
        The third and final Service Pack, SP3, was released through different
        channels between April 21 and June 10, 2008, about a year after the
        release of Windows Vista, and about a year before the release of Windows
        7. Service Pack 3 was not available for Windows XP x64 Edition, which
        was based on the Windows Server 2003 kernel and, as a result, used its
        service packs rather than the ones for the other editions.
      </p>

      <p>
        It began being automatically pushed out to Automatic Updates users on
        July 10, 2008. A feature set overview which detailed new features
        available separately as stand-alone updates to Windows XP, as well as
        backported features from Windows Vista, was posted by Microsoft. A total
        of 1,174 fixes are included in SP3. Service Pack 3 could be installed on
        systems with Internet Explorer up to and including version 8; Internet
        Explorer 7 was not included as part of SP3. It also did not include
        Internet Explorer 8, but instead was included in Windows 7, which was
        released one year after XP SP3.
      </p>

      <p>
        Service Pack 3 included security enhancements over and above those of
        SP2, including APIs allowing developers to enable Data Execution
        Prevention for their code, independent of system-wide compatibility
        enforcement settings, the Security Support Provider Interface,
        improvements to WPA2 security, and an updated version of the Microsoft
        Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Module that is FIPS 140-2 certified.
      </p>

      <p>
        In incorporating all previously released updates not included in SP2,
        Service Pack 3 included many other key features. Windows Imaging
        Component allowed camera vendors to integrate their own proprietary
        image codecs with the operating system's features, such as thumbnails
        and slideshows. In enterprise features, Remote Desktop Protocol 6.1
        included support for ClearType and 32-bit color depth over RDP, while
        improvements made to Windows Management Instrumentation in Windows Vista
        to reduce the possibility of corruption of the WMI repository were
        backported to XP SP3.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, SP3 contains updates to the operating system components of
        Windows XP Media Center Edition (MCE) and Windows XP Tablet PC Edition,
        and security updates for .NET Framework version 1.0, which is included
        in these editions. However, it does not include update rollups for the
        Windows Media Center application in Windows XP MCE 2005. SP3 also omits
        security updates for Windows Media Player 10, although the player is
        included in Windows XP MCE 2005.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <p>
      Windows XP introduced multitudes of new features, but also removed a few.
      These include the changes to the user interface, infrastructure,
      networking and internet functionality and backward compatibility, not to
      mention other features.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Infrastructure</summary>
      <p>
        Windows XP uses prefetching to improve startup and application launch
        times. It also became possible to revert the installation of an updated
        device driver, should the updated driver produce undesirable results.
      </p>

      <p>
        A copy protection system known as Windows Product Activation was
        introduced with Windows XP and its server counterpart, Windows Server
        2003. All non-enterprise (Volume Licensing) Windows licenses must be
        tied to a unique ID generated using information from the computer
        hardware, transmitted either via the internet or a telephone hotline. If
        Windows is not activated within 30 days of installation, the OS will
        cease to function until it is activated. Windows also periodically
        verifies the hardware to check for changes. If significant hardware
        changes are detected, the activation is voided, and Windows must be
        re-activated.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Networking and internet functionality</summary>
      <p>
        Windows XP was originally bundled with Internet Explorer 6, Outlook
        Express 6, Windows Messenger, and MSN Explorer. New networking features
        were also added, including Internet Connection Firewall, Internet
        Connection Sharing integration with UPnP, NAT traversal APIs, Quality of
        Service features, IPv6 and Teredo tunneling, Background Intelligent
        Transfer Service, extended fax features, network bridging, peer to peer
        networking, support for most DSL modems, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) connections
        with auto configuration and roaming, TAPI 3.1, and networking over
        FireWire. Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop were also added, which
        allow users to connect to a computer running Windows XP from across a
        network or the Internet and access their applications, files, printers,
        and devices or request help. Improvements were also made to
        IntelliMirror features such as Offline Files, roaming user profiles, and
        folder redirection.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Backward compatibility</summary>
      <p>
        To enable running software that targets or locks out specific versions
        of Windows, "Compatibility mode" was added. It allows pretending a
        selected earlier version of Windows to software, starting at Windows 95.
        This feature was first introduced in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2,
        released five months before the release of Windows XP, and was
        backported from prerelease Windows XP builds. Unlike with Windows XP,
        however, it was hidden from the operating system as it was not enabled
        by default and had to be manually activated through the Register Server
        utility. It was also only available to administrator users. Windows XP
        has this feature activated out of the box and also grants it to regular
        users.

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
    <p>
      Windows XP was released in two major editions on launch: Home Edition and
      Professional Edition. Both editions were made available at retail as
      pre-loaded software on new computers and as boxed copies. Boxed copies
      were sold as "Upgrade" or "Full" licenses; the "Upgrade" versions were
      slightly cheaper, but require an existing version of Windows to install.
      The "Full" version can be installed on systems without an operating system
      or existing version of Windows. The two editions of XP were aimed at
      different markets: Home Edition is explicitly intended for consumer use
      and disables or removes certain advanced and enterprise-oriented features
      present on Professional, such as the ability to join a Windows domain,
      Internet Information Services, and Multilingual User Interface. Windows 98
      or Me can be upgraded to either edition, but Windows NT 4.0 and Windows
      2000 can only be upgraded to Professional. Windows' software license
      agreement for pre-loaded licenses allows the software to be "returned" to
      the OEM for a refund if the user does not wish to use it. Despite the
      refusal of some manufacturers to honor the entitlement, it has been
      enforced by courts in some countries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two specialized variants of XP were introduced in 2002 for certain types
      of hardware, exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software.
      Windows XP Media Center Edition was initially designed for high-end home
      theater PCs with TV tuners (marketed under the term "Media Center PC"),
      offering expanded multimedia functionality, an electronic program guide,
      and digital video recorder (DVR) support through the Windows Media Center
      application. Microsoft also unveiled Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, which
      contains additional pen input features, and is optimized for mobile
      devices meeting its Tablet PC specifications. Two different 64-bit
      editions of XP were made available. The first, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition,
      was intended for IA-64 (Itanium) systems; as IA-64 usage declined on
      workstations in favor of AMD's x86-64 architecture, the Itanium edition
      was discontinued in January 2005. A new 64-bit edition supporting the
      x86-64 architecture, called Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, was
      released in April 2005.
    </p>

    <p>
      Microsoft also targeted emerging markets with the 2004 introduction of
      Windows XP Starter Edition, a special variant of Home Edition intended for
      low-cost PCs. The OS is primarily aimed at first-time computer owners,
      containing heavy localization (including wallpapers and screen savers
      incorporating images of local landmarks), and a "My Support" area which
      contains video tutorials on basic computing tasks. It also removes certain
      "complex" features, and does not allow users to run more than three
      applications at a time. After a pilot program in India and Thailand,
      Starter was released in other emerging markets throughout 2005. In 2006,
      Microsoft also unveiled the FlexGo initiative, which would also target
      emerging markets with subsidized PCs on a pre-paid, subscription basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result of unfair competition lawsuits in Europe and South Korea,
      which both alleged that Microsoft had improperly leveraged its status in
      the PC market to favor its own bundled software, Microsoft was ordered to
      release special editions of XP in these markets that excluded certain
      applications. In March 2004, after the European Commission fined Microsoft
      €497 million (US$603 million), Microsoft was ordered to release "N"
      editions of XP that excluded Windows Media Player, encouraging users to
      pick and download their own media player software. As it was sold at the
      same price as the edition with Windows Media Player included, certain OEMs
      (such as Dell, who offered it for a short period, along with
      Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Fujitsu Siemens) chose not to offer it.
      Consumer interest was minuscule, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to OEMs,
      and no reported sales to consumers. In December 2005, the Korean Fair
      Trade Commission ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows
      XP and Windows Server 2003 that do not contain Windows Media Player or
      Windows Messenger. The "K" and "KN" editions of Windows XP were released
      in August 2006, and are only available in English and Korean, and also
      contain links to third-party instant messenger and media player software.

      While retaining some similarities to previous versions, Windows XP's
      interface was overhauled with a new visual appearance, with an increased
      use of alpha compositing effects, drop shadows, and "visual styles", which
      completely changed the appearance of the operating system. The number of
      effects enabled are determined by the operating system based on the
      computer's processing power, and can be enabled or disabled on a
      case-by-case basis. XP also added ClearType, a new subpixel rendering
      system designed to improve the appearance of fonts on liquid-crystal
      displays. A new set of system icons was also introduced. The default
      wallpaper, Bliss, is a photo of a landscape in the Napa Valley outside
      Napa, California, with rolling green hills and a blue sky with
      stratocumulus and cirrus clouds.

      The Start menu received its first major overhaul in XP, switching to a
      two-column layout with the ability to list, pin, and display frequently
      used applications, recently opened documents, and the traditional
      cascading "All Programs" menu. The taskbar can now group windows opened by
      a single application into one taskbar button, with a popup menu listing
      the individual windows. The notification area also hides "inactive" icons
      by default. A "common tasks" list was added, and Windows Explorer's
      sidebar was updated to use a new task-based design with lists of common
      actions; the tasks displayed are contextually relevant to the type of
      content in a folder (e.g. a folder with music displays offers to play all
      the files in the folder, or burn them to a CD).

      Fast user switching allows additional users to log into a Windows XP
      machine without existing users having to close their programs and log out.
      Although only one user at the time can use the console (i.e., monitor,
      keyboard, and mouse), previous users can resume their session once they
      regain control of the computer. Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3 also
      introduced new features to Windows XP post-release, including the Windows
      Security Center, Bluetooth support, Data Execution Prevention, Windows
      Firewall, and support for SDHC cards that are larger than 4 GB and smaller
      than 32 GB.

        A screenshot of Windows XP (Professional edition). The UI is completely
        and absolutely fresh, new and overhauled. For people who unwilling to
        learn how to use a completely new interface, there was a "Classic"
        option in the appearance settings.
