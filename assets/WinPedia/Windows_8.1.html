    This webpage does not have a section on editions as there is no information
    on Wikipedia about its editions. The four editions are the base edition
    (simply branded as Windows 8.1), Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise,
    and Windows RT 8.1 (designed for tablet PCs and other mobile devices with
    ARM processors.

    Windows 8.1 is a release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
    Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on August 27, 2013, and broadly
    released for retail sale on October 17, 2013, about a year after the retail
    release of its predecessor, and succeeded by Windows 10 on July 29, 2015.
    Windows 8.1 was made available for download via MSDN and Technet and
    available as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows RT
    users via the Windows Store. A server version, Windows Server 2012 R2, was
    released on October 18, 2013.

    Windows 8.1 aimed to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on
    launch. Enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional snap
    views, additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive)
    integration, Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), a Bing-powered unified search
    system, restoration of a visible Start button on the taskbar, and the
    ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the user's desktop on
    login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also added support for then
    emerging technologies like high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi
    Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as the ReFS file system.

      In February 2013, ZDNet writer Mary Jo Foley disclosed potential rumors
      about "Blue", the codename for a wave of planned updates across several
      Microsoft products and services, including Windows 8, Windows Phone 8,
      Outlook.com, and SkyDrive. In particular, the report detailed that
      Microsoft was planning to shift to a more "continuous" development model,
      which would see major revisions to its main software platforms released on
      a consistent yearly cycle to keep up with market demands. Lending
      credibility to the reports, Foley noted that a Microsoft staff member had
      listed experience with "Windows Blue" on his LinkedIn profile, and listed
      it as a separate operating system from 8.
    </p>

    <p>
      A post-RTM build of Windows 8, build 9364, was leaked in March 2013. The
      build, which was believed to be of "Windows Blue", revealed a number of
      enhancements across Windows 8's interface, including additional size
      options for tiles, expanded color options on the Start screen, the
      expansion of PC Settings to include more options that were previously
      exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, the ability for apps to snap to
      half of the screen, the ability to take screenshots from the Share charm,
      additional stock apps, increased SkyDrive integration (such as automatic
      device backups) and Internet Explorer 11. Shortly afterward on March 26,
      2013, corporate vice president of corporate communications Frank X. Shaw
      officially acknowledged the "Blue" project, stating that continuous
      development would be "the new normal" at Microsoft, and that "Our product
      groups are also taking a unified planning approach so people get what they
      wantâ€”all of their devices, apps and services working together wherever
      they are and for whatever they are doing."
    </p>

    <p>
      On April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the Windows 8.1 Update, which
      included all past updates plus new features, unveiled by Microsoft vice
      president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and
      detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore
      noted that the update would lower the minimum system requirements for
      Windows, so it can be installed on devices with as little as 1 GB of RAM
      and 16 GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is
      distributed through Windows Update, and must be installed in order to
      receive any further patches.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the 2014 Build conference, during April, Microsoft's Terry Myerson
      unveiled further GUI changes for Windows 8.1, including the ability to run
      Metro-style apps inside desktop windows, and a revised Start menu, which
      creates a compromise between the Start menu design used by Windows 7 and
      the Start screen, by combining the application listing in the first column
      with a second that can be used to display app tiles, whereas Windows 8.0
      used a screen hotspot ("hot corner"). Myerson stated that these changes
      would occur in a future update, but did not elaborate further. A
      distinction is the removal of the tooltip with the preview thumbnail of
      the Start screen.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <p>
      Many of the changes on Windows 8.1, particularly to the user interface,
      were made in response to criticisms from early adopters and other critics
      after the release of Windows 8.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Apps</summary>
      <p>
        The suite of pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in
        Windows 8.1; PC Settings was expanded to include options that were
        previously exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was
        updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic
        updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional
        features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas,
        and additional editing tools were added to the Photos app (while
        integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number
        of additional stock apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and
        Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder, Reading List (which can be
        used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and
        Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of
        Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does
        not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or
        creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is
        enabled by default within Windows To Go environments. On January 31,
        2020, Microsoft released the new Microsoft Edge web browser for Windows
        8.1.

      <summary class="level-two">Online services and functionality</summary>
      <p>
        Windows 8.1 adds tighter integration with several Microsoft-owned
        services. OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated at the system level
        to sync user settings and files. Files are automatically downloaded in
        the background when they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder,
        unless they are marked to be available offline. By default, only file
        metadata and thumbnails are stored locally, and reparse points are used
        to give the appearance of a normal directory structure to provide
        backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was updated to include a local
        file manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires that a user's Windows
        account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous SkyDrive desktop
        client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported on Windows
        8.1.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Bing-based unified search system was added; it can analyze a user's
        search habits to return results featuring relevant local and online
        content. Full-screen "hero" displays aggregate news articles, Wikipedia
        entries, multimedia, and other content related to a search query; for
        instance, searching for a music performer would return photos of the
        performer, a biography, and their available songs and albums on Xbox
        Music. The messaging app from Windows 8 has been replaced by Skype,
        which also allows users to accept calls directly from the lock screen.
        Windows 8.1 also includes Internet Explorer 11, which adds support for
        SPDY and WebGL, and expanded developer tools. The Metro-style variant of
        IE11 also adds tab syncing, the ability to open an unlimited number of
        tabs, and Reading List integration.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in
        all bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Security and hardware compatibility</summary>
      <p>
        On compatible hardware, Windows 8.1 also features a transparent "device
        encryption" system based on BitLocker. Encryption begins as soon as a
        user begins using the system; the recovery key is stored to either the
        user's Microsoft account or an Active Directory login, allowing it to be
        retrieved from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all
        editions of Windows 8.1 unlike BitLocker (which is exclusive to the Pro
        and Enterprise editions), device encryption requires that the device
        meet the Connected Standby specification and have a Trusted Platform
        Module (TPM) 2.0 chip. Windows 8.1 also introduces improved fingerprint
        recognition APIs, which allows user login, User Account Control, Windows
        Store and Windows Store apps to use enrolled fingerprints as an
        authentication method. A new kiosk mode known as "Assigned Access" was
        also added, allowing a device to be configured to use a single app in a
        restricted environment. Additionally, Windows Defender includes an
        intrusion detection system which can scan network activity for signs of
        malware. Windows 8.1 also allows third-party VPN clients to
        automatically trigger connections.
      </p>

      <p>
        For enterprise device management, Windows 8.1 adds support for the
        Workplace Join feature of Windows Server 2012 R2, which allows users to
        enroll their own device into corporate networks with finer control over
        access to resources and security requirements. Windows 8.1 also supports
        the OMA Device Management specifications. Remote Data Control can be
        used to remotely wipe specific "corporate" data from Windows 8.1
        devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 64-bit variants of Windows 8.1 no longer support processors which do
        not implement the double-width compare and exchange (CMPXCHG16B) CPU
        instruction (which the installer reports as a lack of support for
        "CompareExchange128"). A Microsoft spokesperson noted that the change
        primarily affects systems with older AMD 64-bit processors, and that
        "the number of affected processors are extremely small since this
        instruction has been supported for greater than 10 years." It mostly
        concerns Socket 754 and Socket 939 Athlon 64 from 2004 and 2005; the
        Socket AM2 CPUs should all have the instruction. Brad Chacos of PC World
        also reported a case in which Windows 8.1 rejected Intel Core 2 Quad
        Q9300 and a Q9550S despite their support for this instruction, because
        the associated Intel DP35DP motherboard did not. These changes do not
        affect the 32-bit variants of Windows 8.1.

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Hardware functionality</summary>
      <p>
        Windows 8.1 adds support for 3D printing, pairing with printers using
        NFC tags, Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast media streaming, tethering, and NVMe.
        In response to the increasing pixel density in displays, Windows 8.1 can
        scale text and GUI elements up to 200% (whereas Windows 8 supported only
        150%) and set scaling settings independently on each display in
        multi-monitor configurations.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Removed features</summary>
      <p>
        Backup and Restore, the backup component of Windows that had been
        deprecated but was available in Windows 8 through a Control Panel applet
        called "Windows 7 File Recovery", was removed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 8.1 also removes the graphical user interface for the Windows
        System Assessment Tool, meaning that the Windows Experience Index is no
        longer displayed. The command line variant of the tool remains available
        on the system. Microsoft reportedly removed the graphical Windows
        Experience Index in order to promote the idea that all kinds of hardware
        run Windows 8 equally well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 8.1 removed the ability of several Universal Windows Platform
        apps to act as "hubs" connecting similar services within a single
        interface:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Photos app lost the ability to view photos from Facebook, Flickr
          or SkyDrive (branded as OneDrive since February 2014). Instead, each
          service provider is expected to create its own app.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Messaging app, which was interoperable with Windows Live Messenger
          and Facebook Chat, was deprecated in favor of a Skype app that is not
          compatible with Facebook Chat;
        </li>
        <li>
          The Calendar app can only connect to Microsoft services such as
          Outlook.com and Microsoft Exchange, with support for Google Calendar
          removed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Since October 2016, all future patches are cumulative as with Windows
          10; individual patches can no longer be downloaded.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Users can only upgrade their previous version of Windows to Windows 8.1
        using the revised installer introduced in Windows 8: they can no longer
        use setup.exe in the sources folder to upgrade their system.
      </p>
    </details>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">User interface and desktop</summary>
    <p>
      The Start screen received several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including
      an extended "All Apps" view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new
      down arrow button or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for
      tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional
      customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new
      backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), and the ability
      for the Start screen to use the desktop background instead. Applications
      were no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and
      all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously
      shown in a single color). The app snapping system was also extended; up to
      four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size,
      apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and can also be used on any
      display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps
      in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a
      photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the
      screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a
      portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use
      a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by
      swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism
      which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from
      them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also
      automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and
      suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows
      Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to
      indicate the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on
      the dots, or right-clicking.
    </p>

    <p>
      To improve the usability of the desktop interface, a visible Start button
      was restored to the taskbar for opening the Start screen, and the Quick
      Links menu (accessed by right-clicking the Start button or pressing Win+X)
      now contains shutdown and sign-out options. Users can also modify certain
      user interface behaviors, such as disabling the upper hot corners for
      using the charms and recent apps list, going to the desktop instead of the
      Start screen on login or after closing all apps on a screen, automatically
      opening the "All Apps" view on the Start screen when opened, and
      prioritizing desktop programs on the "Category" sort mode on "All Apps".
      To assist users in learning the Windows 8 user interface, an interactive
      tutorial was also offered, along with a new Help + Tips app for additional
      information. In contrast, Windows RT 8.1 downplays the desktop interface
      further by not displaying the Desktop tile on its default Start screen at
      all (however, it can still be manually added to the Start screen).
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen stated that the restoration of the
      visible Start button was intended to be a "warm blanket" for users who had
      become confused by the removal of the button on 8; the Start button was
      originally removed to reflect Windows 8's treatment of the desktop as an
      "app" rather than the main interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further interface behavior changes are made on the April 2014 "Windows 8.1
      Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such as
      desktop and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve
      integration between Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse is in
      use, the Desktop is shown on startup by default, the Start screen uses
      context menus instead of a toolbar across the bottom of the screen for
      manipulating tiles, an autohiding title bar with minimize and close
      buttons is displayed within apps at the top of the screen, the taskbar can
      display and pin apps alongside desktop programs and be accessed from
      within apps, and visible search and power buttons are added to the Start
      screen. In non-touch environments, the default image viewer and media
      player programs were changed back to Windows Photo Viewer and Windows
      Media Player in lieu of the Xbox Video and Photos apps.
