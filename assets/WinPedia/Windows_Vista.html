    Windows Vista is a major release of the Windows NT series of operating
    systems developed by Microsoft. It was the direct successor to Windows XP,
    which was released five years earlier. This was then the longest time span
    between successive releases of Microsoft Windows. It was released to
    manufacturing on November 8, 2006, and over the following two months, it was
    released in stages to business customers, original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs), and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released
    internationally and was made available for purchase and download from the
    Windows Marketplace; it is the first release of Windows to be made available
    through a digital distribution platform.

  <p>
    Development of Windows Vista began in 2001 under the codename "Longhorn". It
    was originally meant to be a minor successor to Windows XP, but it gradually
    included numerous new features from the then-next major release of Windows
    codenamed "Blackcomb", after which it was repositioned as a major release of
    Windows, and it subsequently underwent a period of protracted development
    that was unprecedented for Microsoft. Most new features were prominently
    based on a new presentation layer codenamed Avalon, a new communications
    architecture codenamed Indigo, and a relational storage platform codenamed
    WinFS â€” all built on the .NET Framework; however, this proved to be
    untenable due to incompleteness of technologies and ways in which new
    features were added, and Microsoft reset the project in 2004. Many features
    were eventually reimplemented after the reset, but Microsoft ceased using
    managed code to develop the operating system.
  </p>

  <p>
    New features of Windows Vista include a graphical user interface and visual
    style referred to as Windows Aero; a content index and desktop search
    platform called Windows Search; new peer-to-peer technologies to simplify
    sharing files and media between computers and devices on a home network; and
    new multimedia tools such as Windows DVD Maker. Windows Vista included .NET
    Framework version 3.0, allowing software developers to write applications
    without traditional Windows APIs. There are major architectural overhauls to
    audio, display, network, and print sub-systems; deployment, installation,
    servicing, and startup procedures are also revised. It is the first release
    of Windows built on Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing initiative and
    emphasized security with the introduction of many new security and safety
    features such as BitLocker and the infamous User Account Control.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ambitiousness and scope of these changes, and the abundance of new
    features earned positive reviews, but Windows Vista was the subject of
    frequent negative press and significant criticism. Criticism of Windows
    Vista focused on driver, peripheral, and program incompatibility; digital
    rights management; excessive authorization from the new User Account
    Control; inordinately high system requirements when contrasted with Windows
    XP; its protracted development; longer boot time; and more restrictive
    product licensing. Windows Vista deployment and satisfaction rates were
    consequently lower than those of Windows XP, and it is considered a market
    failure; however, its use surpassed Microsoft's pre-launch two-year-out
    expectations of achieving 200 million users (with an estimated 330 million
    users by 2009). Two service packs were released, in 2008 and 2009
    respectively. Windows Vista was succeeded by Windows 7 in 2009, and on
    October 22, 2010 Microsoft ceased retail distribution of Windows Vista; OEM
    supply ceased a year later. Mainstream support for Windows Vista ended on
    April 10, 2012 and extended support ended on April 11, 2017.

      Microsoft began work on Windows Vista, known at the time by its codename
      "Longhorn", in May 2001, five months before the release of Windows XP. It
      was originally expected to ship in October 2003 as a minor step between
      Windows XP and "Blackcomb", which was planned to be the company's next
      major operating system release. Gradually, "Longhorn" assimilated many of
      the important new features and technologies slated for Blackcomb,
      resulting in the release date being pushed back several times in three
      years. In some builds of Longhorn, their license agreement said "For the
      Microsoft product codenamed 'Whistler'". Many of Microsoft's developers
      were also re-tasked to build updates to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
      to strengthen security. Faced with ongoing delays and concerns about
      feature creep, Microsoft announced on August 27, 2004, that it had revised
      its plans. For this reason, Longhorn was reset to start work on
      componentizing the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 codebase, and over
      time re-incorporating the features that would be intended for an actual
      operating system release. However, some previously announced features such
      as WinFS were dropped or postponed, and a new software development
      methodology called the Security Development Lifecycle was incorporated to
      address concerns with the security of the Windows codebase, which is
      programmed in C, C++ and assembly. Longhorn became known as Vista in 2005.
      Vista in Spanish means view.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Longhorn</summary>
      <p>
        The early development stages of Longhorn were generally characterized by
        incremental improvements and updates to Windows XP. During this period,
        Microsoft was fairly quiet about what was being worked on, as their
        marketing and public relations efforts were more strongly focused on
        Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003, which was released in April 2003.
        Occasional builds of Longhorn were leaked onto popular file sharing
        networks such as IRC, BitTorrent, eDonkey and various newsgroups, and so
        most of what is known about builds before the first sanctioned
        development release of Longhorn in May 2003 is derived from these
        builds.
      </p>

      <p>
        After several months of relatively little news or activity from
        Microsoft with Longhorn, Microsoft released Build 4008, which had made
        an appearance on the Internet around February 28, 2003. It was also
        privately handed out to a select group of software developers. As an
        evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained several small
        improvements, including a modified blue "Plex" theme and a new,
        simplified Windows Image-based installer that operates in graphical mode
        from the outset, and completed an install of the operating system in
        approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the same hardware. An
        optional "new taskbar" was introduced that was thinner than the previous
        build and displayed the time differently. The most notable visual and
        functional difference, however, came with Windows Explorer. The
        incorporation of the Plex theme made blue the dominant color of the
        entire application. The Windows XP-style task pane was almost completely
        replaced with a large horizontal pane that appeared under the toolbars.
        A new search interface allowed for filtering of results, searching for
        Windows help, and natural-language queries that would be used to
        integrate with WinFS. The animated search characters were also removed.
        The "view modes" were also replaced with a single slider that would
        resize the icons in real-time, in the list, thumbnail, or details mode,
        depending on where the slider was. File metadata was also made more
        visible and more easily editable, with more active encouragement to fill
        out missing pieces of information. Also of note was the conversion of
        Windows Explorer to being a .NET application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most builds of Longhorn and Vista were identified by a label that was
        always displayed in the bottom-right corner of the desktop. A typical
        build label would look like "Longhorn Build 3683.Lab06_N.020923-1821".
        Higher build numbers did not automatically mean that the latest features
        from every development team at Microsoft was included. Typically, a team
        working on a certain feature or subsystem would generate their working
        builds which developers would test with, and when the code was deemed
        stable, all the changes would be incorporated back into the main
        development tree at once. At Microsoft, several "Build labs" exist where
        the compilation of the entirety of Windows can be performed by a team.
        The name of the lab in which any given build originated is shown as part
        of the build label, and the date and time of the build follow that. Some
        builds (such as Beta 1 and Beta 2) only display the build label in the
        version information dialog (Winver). The icons used in these builds are
        from Windows XP.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference (WinHEC) in May 2003,
        Microsoft gave their first public demonstrations of the new Desktop
        Window Manager and Aero. The demonstrations were done on a revised build
        4015 which was never released. Several sessions for developers and
        hardware engineers at the conference focused on these new features, as
        well as the Next-Generation Secure Computing Base (previously known as
        "Palladium"), which at the time was Microsoft's proposed solution for
        creating a secure computing environment whereby any given component of
        the system could be deemed "trusted". Also at this conference, Microsoft
        reiterated their roadmap for delivering Longhorn, pointing to an "early
        2005" release date.

        By 2004, it had become obvious to the Windows team at Microsoft that
        they were losing sight of what needed to be done to complete the next
        version of Windows and ship it to customers. Internally, some Microsoft
        employees were describing the Longhorn project as "another Cairo" or
        "Cairo.NET", referring to the Cairo development project that the company
        embarked on through the first half of the 1990s, which never resulted in
        a shipping operating system (though nearly all the technologies
        developed in that time did end up in Windows 95 and Windows NT).
        Microsoft was shocked in 2005 by Apple's release of Mac OS X Tiger. It
        offered only a limited subset of features planned for Longhorn, in
        particular fast file searching and integrated graphics and sound
        processing, but appeared to have impressive reliability and performance
        compared to contemporary Longhorn builds. Most Longhorn builds had major
        Windows Explorer system leaks which prevented the OS from performing
        well, and added more confusion to the development teams in later builds
        with more and more code being developed which failed to reach stability.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a September 23, 2005 front-page article in The Wall Street Journal,
        Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin, who had overall responsibility for
        the development and delivery of Windows, explained how development of
        Longhorn had been "crashing into the ground" due in large part to the
        haphazard methods by which features were introduced and integrated into
        the core of the operating system, without a clear focus on an
        end-product. Allchin went on to explain how in December 2003, he
        enlisted the help of two other senior executives, Brian Valentine and
        Amitabh Srivastava, the former being experienced with shipping software
        at Microsoft, most notably Windows Server 2003, and the latter having
        spent his career at Microsoft researching and developing methods of
        producing high-quality testing systems. Srivastava employed a team of
        core architects to visually map out the entirety of the Windows
        operating system, and to proactively work towards a development process
        that would enforce high levels of code quality, reduce interdependencies
        between components, and in general, "not make things worse with Vista".
        Since Microsoft decided that Longhorn needed to be further
        componentized, work started on builds (known as the Omega-13 builds,
        named after a time travel device in the film Galaxy Quest) that would
        componentize existing Windows Server 2003 source code, and over time add
        back functionality as development progressed. Future Longhorn builds
        would start from Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 and continue from
        there.
      </p>

      <p>
        This change, announced internally to Microsoft employees on August 26,
        2004, began in earnest in September, though it would take several more
        months before the new development process and build methodology would be
        used by all of the development teams. A number of complaints came from
        individual developers, and Bill Gates himself, that the new development
        process was going to be prohibitively difficult to work within.

      <summary class="level-two">As Windows Vista</summary>
      <p>
        By approximately November 2004, the company had considered several names
        for the final release, ranging from simple to fanciful and inventive. In
        the end, Microsoft chose Windows Vista as confirmed on July 22, 2005,
        believing it to be a "wonderful intersection of what the product really
        does, what Windows stands for, and what resonates with customers, and
        their needs". Group Project Manager Greg Sullivan told Paul Thurrott
        "You want the PC to adapt to you and help you cut through the clutter to
        focus on what's important to you. That's what Windows Vista is all
        about: "bringing clarity to your world" (a reference to the three
        marketing points of Vistaâ€”Clear, Connected, Confident), so you can focus
        on what matters to you". Microsoft co-president Jim Allchin also loved
        the name, saying that "Vista creates the right imagery for the new
        product capabilities and inspires the imagination with all the
        possibilities of what can be done with Windowsâ€”making people's passions
        come alive."
      </p>

      <p>
        After Longhorn was named Windows Vista in July 2005, an unprecedented
        beta-test program was started, involving hundreds of thousands of
        volunteers and companies. In September of that year, Microsoft started
        releasing regular Community Technology Previews (CTP) to beta testers
        from July 2005 to February 2006. The first of these was distributed at
        the 2005 Microsoft Professional Developers Conference, and was
        subsequently released to beta testers and Microsoft Developer Network
        subscribers. The builds that followed incorporated most of the planned
        features for the final product, as well as a number of changes to the
        user interface, based largely on feedback from beta testers. Windows
        Vista was deemed feature-complete with the release of the "February
        CTP", released on February 22, 2006, and much of the remainder of the
        work between that build and the final release of the product focused on
        stability, performance, application and driver compatibility, and
        documentation. Beta 2, released in late May, was the first build to be
        made available to the general public through Microsoft's Customer
        Preview Program. It was downloaded over 5 million times. Two release
        candidates followed in September and October, both of which were made
        available to a large number of users.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the Intel Developer Forum on March 9, 2006, Microsoft announced a
        change in their plans to support EFI in Windows Vista. The UEFI 2.0
        specification (which replaced EFI 1.10) was not completed until early
        2006, and at the time of Microsoft's announcement, no firmware
        manufacturers had completed a production implementation which could be
        used for testing. As a result, the decision was made to postpone the
        introduction of UEFI support to Windows; support for UEFI on 64-bit
        platforms was postponed until Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server
        2008 and 32-bit UEFI would not be supported, as Microsoft did not expect
        many such systems to be built because the market was quickly moving to
        64-bit processors.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Microsoft had originally hoped to have the consumer versions of
        the operating system available worldwide in time for the 2006 holiday
        shopping season, it announced in March 2006 that the release date would
        be pushed back to January 2007 in order to give the companyâ€”and the
        hardware and software companies that Microsoft depends on for providing
        device driversâ€”additional time to prepare. Because a release to
        manufacturing (RTM) build is the final version of code shipped to
        retailers and other distributors, the purpose of a pre-RTM build is to
        eliminate any last "show-stopper" bugs that may prevent the code from
        responsibly being shipped to customers, as well as anything else that
        consumers may find troublesome. Thus, it is unlikely that any major new
        features would be introduced; instead, work would focus on Vista's fit
        and finish. In just a few days, developers had managed to drop Vista's
        bug count from over 2470 on September 22 to just over 1400 by the time
        RC2 shipped in early October. However, they still had a way to go before
        Vista was ready to RTM. Microsoft's internal processes required Vista's
        bug count to drop to 500 or fewer before the product could go into
        escrow for RTM. For most of the pre-RTM builds, only 32-bit editions
        were released.
      </p>

      <p>
        On June 14, 2006, Windows developer Philip Su posted a blog entry which
        decried the development process of Windows Vista, stating that "The code
        is way too complicated, and that the pace of coding has been
        tremendously slowed down by overbearing process." The same post also
        described Windows Vista as having approximately 50 million lines of
        code, with about 2,000 developers working on the product. During a
        demonstration of the speech recognition feature new to Windows Vista at
        Microsoft's Financial Analyst Meeting on July 27, 2006, the software
        recognized the phrase "Dear mom" as "Dear aunt". After several failed
        attempts to correct the error, the sentence eventually became "Dear
        aunt, let's set so double the killer delete select all". A developer
        with Vista's speech recognition team later explained that there was a
        bug with the build of Vista that was causing the microphone gain level
        to be set very high, resulting in the audio being received by the speech
        recognition software being "incredibly distorted".
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows Vista build 5824 (October 17, 2006) was supposed to be the RTM
        release, but a bug, where the OOBE hangs at the start of the WinSAT
        Assessment (if upgraded from Windows XP), requiring the user to
        terminate msoobe.exe by pressing Shift+F10 to open Command Prompt using
        either command-line tools or Task Manager prevented this, damaging
        development and lowering the chance that it would hit its January 2007
        deadline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Development of Windows Vista came to an end when Microsoft announced
        that it had been finalized on November 8, 2006, and was concluded by
        co-president of Windows development, Jim Allchin. The RTM's build number
        had also jumped to 6000 to reflect Vista's internal version number, NT
        6.0. Jumping RTM build numbers is common practice among
        consumer-oriented Windows versions, like Windows 98 (build 1998),
        Windows 98 SE (build 2222), Windows Me (build 3000) or Windows XP (build
        2600), as compared to the business-oriented versions like Windows 2000
        (build 2195) or Server 2003 (build 3790). On November 16, 2006,
        Microsoft made the final build available to MSDN and Technet Plus
        subscribers. A business-oriented Enterprise edition was made available
        to volume license customers on November 30, 2006. Windows Vista was
        launched for general customer availability on January 30, 2007.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <p>
      New features introduced by Windows Vista are very numerous, encompassing
      significant functionality not available in its predecessors. Do not
      explore this in detail if you simply want a brief list of features. Many
      new features include changes to the user interface, core, security, system
      management, features for developers and the installation process. A list
      of these features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">Changes to the User Interface: </span>Windows Vista introduced
        a new visual theme, Aero, which replaced
        Windows XP's Luna theme.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">Programs:</span>
        Many new applications were introduced with Windows Vista, including
        Internet Explorer 7, Media Player 11, Windows Defender, Windows
        Calendar, Windows Mail, Windows Photo Viewer and many more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">Changes and improvements to the core:</span>
        Vista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive, which
        employ fast flash memory (located on USB flash drives and hybrid hard
        disk drives) to improve system performance by caching commonly used
        programs and data. As part of the redesign of the networking
        architecture, IPv6 has been fully incorporated into the operating system
        and a number of performance improvements have been introduced, such as
        TCP window scaling. For graphics, Vista introduces a new Windows Display
        Driver Model and a major revision to Direct3D. The new driver model
        facilitates the new Desktop Window Manager, which provides the
        tearing-free desktop and special effects that are the cornerstones of
        Windows Aero. At the core of the operating system, many improvements
        have been made to the memory manager, process scheduler and I/O
        scheduler.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">New features and improvements to security:</span>
        Improved security was a primary design goal for Vista. Microsoft's
        Trustworthy Computing initiative, which aims to improve public trust in
        its products, has had a direct effect on its development. This effort
        has resulted in a number of new security and safety features and an
        Evaluation Assurance Level rating of 4+.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">System Management:</span>
        While much of the focus of Vista's new capabilities highlighted the new
        user interface, security technologies, and improvements to the core
        operating system, Microsoft also added new deployment and maintenance
        features
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 2.2vh">New features for developers:</span>
        Windows Vista includes a large number of new application programming
        interfaces. Chief among them is the inclusion of version 3.0 of the .NET
        Framework, which consists of a class library and Common Language
        Runtime. There are also significant new development APIs in the core of
        the operating system, notably the completely re-designed audio,
        networking, print, and video interfaces, major changes to the security
        infrastructure, improvements to the deployment and installation of

        Windows Aero is the new graphical user interface, which Jim Allchin
        stated is an acronym for Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open.
        Microsoft intended the new interface to be cleaner and more
        aesthetically pleasing than those of previous Windows versions, and it
        features advanced visual effects such as blurred glass translucencies
        and dynamic glass reflections and smooth window animations. Laptop users
        report, however, that enabling Aero reduces battery life and reduces
        performance. Windows Aero requires a compositing window manager called
        Desktop Window Manager.

        Windows Shell offers a new range of organization, navigation, and search
        capabilities: Task Panes in Windows Explorer are removed, with the
        relevant tasks moved to a new command bar. The navigation pane can now
        be displayed when tasks are available, and it has been updated to
        include a new "Favorite Links" that houses shortcuts to common
        locations. An incremental search box now appears at all times in Windows
        Explorer. The address bar has been replaced with a breadcrumb navigation
        bar, which means that multiple locations in a hierarchy can be navigated
        without needing to go back and forth between locations. Icons now
        display thumbnails depicting contents of items and can be dynamically
        scaled in size (up to 256 Ã— 256 pixels). A new preview pane allows users
        to see thumbnails of items and play tracks, read contents of documents,
        and view photos when they are selected. Groups of items are now
        selectable and display the number of items in each group. A new details
        pane allows users to manage metadata. There are several new sharing
        features, including the ability to directly share files. The Start menu
        also now includes an incremental search box â€” allowing the user to press
        the Win key and start typing to instantly find an item or launch a
        program â€” and the All Programs list uses a vertical scroll bar instead
        of the cascading flyout menu of Windows XP.

          Internet Explorer 7 is a significant revision over Internet Explorer 6
          with a new user interface comprising additional address bar features,
          a new search box, enhanced page zoom, RSS feed functionality, and
          support for tabbed browsing (with an optional "quick tabs" feature
          that shows thumbnails of each open tab). Anti-phishing software is
          introduced that combines client-side scanning with an optional online
          service; it checks with Microsoft the address being visited to
          determine its legitimacy, compares the address with a locally stored
          list of legitimate addresses, and uses heuristics to determine whether
          an address's characteristics are indicative of phishing attempts. In
          Windows Vista, it runs in isolation from other applications (protected
          mode); exploits and malicious software are restricted from writing to
          any location beyond Temporary Internet Files without explicit user
          consent.

          installed that requires a machine to be restarted has been revised,
          with new options to postpone an operating system restart indefinitely,
          by 10 minutes, by 1 hour, or by 4 hours (in Windows XP, users could
          only repeatedly dismiss the prompt to restart, or allow the machine to

        Vista includes technologies such as ReadyBoost and ReadyDrive, which
        employ fast flash memory (located on USB flash drives and hybrid hard
        disk drives) to improve system performance by caching commonly used
        programs and data. This manifests itself in improved battery life on
        notebook computers as well, since a hybrid drive can be spun down when
        not in use. Another new technology called SuperFetch utilizes machine
        learning techniques to analyze usage patterns to allow Windows Vista to
        make intelligent decisions about what content should be present in
        system memory at any given time. It uses almost all the extra RAM as
        disk cache. In conjunction with SuperFetch, an automatic built-in
        Windows Disk Defragmenter makes sure that those applications are
        strategically positioned on the hard disk where they can be loaded into
        memory very quickly with the least physical movement of the hard disk's
        read-write heads.

        As part of the redesign of the networking architecture, IPv6 has been
        fully incorporated into the operating system and a number of performance
        improvements have been introduced, such as TCP window scaling. Earlier
        versions of Windows typically needed third-party wireless networking
        software to work properly, but this is not the case with Vista, which
        includes more comprehensive wireless networking support.

        For graphics, Vista introduces a new Windows Display Driver Model and a
        major revision to Direct3D. The new driver model facilitates the new
        Desktop Window Manager, which provides the tearing-free desktop and
        special effects that are the cornerstones of Windows Aero. Direct3D 10,
        developed in conjunction with major graphics card manufacturers, is a
        new architecture with more advanced shader support, and allows the
        graphics processing unit to render more complex scenes without
        assistance from the CPU. It features improved load balancing between CPU
        and GPU and also optimizes data transfer between them. WDDM also
        provides video content playback that rivals typical consumer electronics
        devices. It does this by making it easy to connect to external monitors,
        providing for protected HD video playback, and increasing overall video
        playback quality. For the first time in Windows, graphics processing
        unit (GPU) multitasking is possible, enabling users to run more than one
        GPU-intensive application simultaneously.

        At the core of the operating system, many improvements have been made to

        order to improve robustness and defend against buffer overflow security
        exploits, although this comes at the price of breaking backward
        compatibility with some legacy applications. A Kernel Transaction
        Manager has been implemented that enables applications to work with the
        file system and Registry using atomic transaction operations.

        Improved security was a primary design goal for Vista. Microsoft's
        Trustworthy Computing initiative, which aims to improve public trust in
        its products, has had a direct effect on its development. This effort
        has resulted in a number of new security and safety features and an
        Evaluation Assurance Level rating of 4+.
      </p>

      <p>
        User Account Control, or UAC is perhaps the most significant and visible
        of these changes. UAC is a security technology that makes it possible
        for users to use their computer with fewer privileges by default, to
        stop malware from making unauthorized changes to the system. This was
        often difficult in previous versions of Windows, as the previous
        "limited" user accounts proved too restrictive and incompatible with a
        large proportion of application software, and even prevented some basic
        operations such as looking at the calendar from the notification tray.
        In Windows Vista, when an action is performed that requires
        administrative rights (such as installing/uninstalling software or
        making system-wide configuration changes), the user is first prompted
        for an administrator name and password; in cases where the user is
        already an administrator, the user is still prompted to confirm the
        pending privileged action. Regular use of the computer such as running
        programs, printing, or surfing the Internet does not trigger UAC
        prompts. User Account Control asks for credentials in a Secure Desktop
        mode, in which the entire screen is dimmed, and only the authorization
        window is active and highlighted. The intent is to stop a malicious
        program from misleading the user by interfering with the authorization
        window, and to hint to the user about the importance of the prompt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Testing by Symantec Corporation has proven the effectiveness of UAC.
        Symantec used over 2,000 active malware samples, consisting of
        backdoors, keyloggers, rootkits, mass mailers, trojan horses, spyware,
        adware, and various other samples. Each was executed on a default
        Windows Vista installation within a standard user account. UAC
        effectively blocked over 50 percent of each threat, excluding rootkits.
        5 percent or less of the malware that evaded UAC survived a reboot.

        Internet Explorer 7's new security and safety features include a
        phishing filter, IDN with anti-spoofing capabilities, and integration
        with system-wide parental controls. For added security, ActiveX controls
        are disabled by default. Also, Internet Explorer operates in a protected
        mode, which operates with lower permissions than the user and runs in
        isolation from other applications in the operating system, preventing it
        from accessing or modifying anything besides the Temporary Internet
        Files directory. Microsoft's anti-spyware product, Windows Defender, has
        been incorporated into Windows, protecting against malware and other
        threats. Changes to various system configuration settings (such as new
        auto-starting applications) are blocked unless the user gives consent.

        Whereas prior releases of Windows supported per-file encryption using
        Encrypting File System, the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista
        include BitLocker Drive Encryption, which can protect entire volumes,
        notably the operating system volume. However, BitLocker requires
        approximately a 1.5-gigabyte partition to be permanently not encrypted
        and to contain system files for Windows to boot. In normal
        circumstances, the only time this partition is accessed is when the
        computer is booting, or when there is a Windows update that changes
        files in this area, which is a legitimate reason to access this section
        of the drive. The area can be a potential security issue, because a
        hexadecimal editor (such as dskprobe.exe), or malicious software running
        with administrator and/or kernel level privileges would be able to write
        to this "Ghost Partition" and allow a piece of malicious software to
        compromise the system, or disable the encryption. BitLocker can work in
        conjunction with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cryptoprocessor
        (version 1.2) embedded in a computer's motherboard, or with a USB key.
        However, as with other full disk encryption technologies, BitLocker is
        vulnerable to a cold boot attack, especially where TPM is used as a key
        protector without a boot PIN being required too.
      </p>

      <p>
        A variety of other privilege-restriction techniques are also built into
        Vista. An example is the concept of "integrity levels" in user
        processes, whereby a process with a lower integrity level cannot
        interact with processes of a higher integrity level and cannot perform
        DLLâ€“injection to processes of a higher integrity level. The security
        restrictions of Windows services are more fine-grained, so that services
        (especially those listening on the network) cannot interact with parts
        of the operating system they do not need to. Obfuscation techniques such
        as address space layout randomization are used to increase the amount of
        effort required of malware before successful infiltration of a system.
        Code integrity verifies that system binaries have not been tampered with
        by malicious code.

        As part of the redesign of the network stack, Windows Firewall has been

        The 64-bit versions of Vista require that all new Kernel-Mode device
        drivers be digitally signed, so that the creator of the driver can be
        identified. This is also on par with one of the primary goals of Vista
        to move code out of kernel-mode into user-mode drivers, with another
        example being the new Windows Display Driver Model.

        features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Windows Imaging Format (WIM) provides the cornerstone of
          Microsoft's new deployment and packaging system. WIM files, which
          contain a HAL-independent image of Windows Vista, can be maintained
          and patched without having to rebuild new images. Windows Images can
          be delivered via Systems Management Server or Business Desktop
          Deployment technologies. Images can be customized and configured with
          applications then deployed to corporate client personal computers
          using little to no touch by a system administrator. ImageX is the
          Microsoft tool used to create and customize images.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Deployment Services replaces Remote Installation Services for
          deploying Vista and prior versions of Windows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Approximately 700 new Group Policy settings have been added, covering
          most aspects of the new features in the operating system, as well as
          significantly expanding the configurability of wireless networks,
          removable storage devices, and user desktop experience. Vista also
          introduced an XML-based format (ADMX) to display registry-based policy
          settings, making it easier to manage networks that span geographic
          locations and different languages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Services for UNIX, renamed as "Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications",
          comes with the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Vista. Network File
          System (NFS) client support is also included.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multilingual User Interface â€“ Unlike previous versions of Windows
          (which required the loading of language packs to provide
          local-language support), Windows Vista Ultimate and Enterprise
          editions support the ability to dynamically change languages based on
          the logged-on user's preference.

      <p>
        Windows Vista includes a large number of new application programming
        interfaces. Chief among them is the inclusion of version 3.0 of the .NET
        Framework, which consists of a class library and Common Language
        Runtime. Version 3.0 includes four new major components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Windows Presentation Foundation is a user interface subsystem and
          framework based vector graphics, which makes use of 3D computer
          graphics hardware and Direct3D technologies. It provides the
          foundation for building applications and blending application UI,
          documents, and media content. It is the successor to Windows Forms.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Communication Foundation is a service-oriented messaging
          subsystem that enables applications and systems to interoperate
          locally or remotely using Web services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Workflow Foundation provides task automation and integrated
          transactions using workflows. It is the programming model, engine, and
          tools for building workflow-enabled applications on Windows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows CardSpace is a component that securely stores digital
          identities of a person, and provides a unified interface for choosing
          the identity for a particular transaction, such as logging into a
          website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These technologies are also available for Windows XP and Windows Server
        2003 to facilitate their introduction to and usage by developers and
        end-users.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also significant new development APIs in the core of the
        operating system, notably the completely re-designed audio, networking,
        print, and video interfaces, major changes to the security
        infrastructure, improvements to the deployment and installation of
        applications ("ClickOnce" and Windows Installer 4.0), new device driver
        development model ("Windows Driver Foundation"), Transactional NTFS,
        mobile computing API advancements (power management, Tablet PC Ink
        support, SideShow) and major updates to (or complete replacements of)
        many core subsystems such as Winlogon and CAPI.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some issues for software developers using some of the graphics
        APIs in Vista. Games or programs built solely on the Windows
        Vista-exclusive version of DirectX, version 10, cannot work on prior
        versions of Windows, as DirectX 10 is not available for previous Windows
        versions. Also, games that require the features of D3D9Ex, the updated
        implementation of DirectX 9 in Windows Vista are also incompatible with
        previous Windows versions. According to a Microsoft blog, there are
        three choices for OpenGL implementation on Vista. An application can use
        the default implementation, which translates OpenGL calls into the
        Direct3D API and is frozen at OpenGL version 1.4, or an application can
        use an Installable Client Driver (ICD), which comes in two flavors:
        legacy and Vista-compatible. A legacy ICD disables the Desktop Window
        Manager, a Vista-compatible ICD takes advantage of a new API, and is
        fully compatible with the Desktop Window Manager. At least two primary
        vendors, ATI and NVIDIA provided full Vista-compatible ICDs. However,
        hardware overlay is not supported, because it is considered as an
        obsolete feature in Vista. ATI and NVIDIA strongly recommend using
        compositing desktop/Framebuffer Objects for same functionality.

      <summary class="level-two">Installation</summary>
      <p>Windows Vista is the first Microsoft operating system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To use DVD-ROM media for installation</li>
        <li>
          To provide during setup a selection of multiple editions of Windows
          available for installation (a license determines which version of
          Windows Vista is eligible for installation) that can be installed only
          on a partition formatted with the NTFS file system.
        </li>
        <li>
          That supports installation from either OEM or retail media and during
          setup the input of a single license regardless of the installation
          source (previous releases of Windows maintained OEM and retail
          versions separately â€” users installing Windows from a
          manufacturer-supplied source could not input a retail license during
          setup, and users installing Windows from a retail source could not
          input a manufacturer-supplied license).
        </li>
        <li>
          That supports loading drivers for SCSI, SATA and RAID controllers from
          any source (such as optical disc drives and USB flash drives) in
          addition to floppy disks prior to its installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          That can be installed on and booted from systems with GPT disks and
          UEFI firmware.

    <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
    <p>
      Windows Vista shipped in six different product editions. These were
      deviced across separate consumer and business target markets, with
      editions varying in features to cater to specific sub-markets. For
      consumers, there are three editions, with two available for economically
      more developed countries. Windows Vista Starter edition is aimed at
      low-powered computers with availability only in emerging markets. Windows
      Vista Home Basic is intended for budget users. Windows Vista Home Premium
      covers the majority of the consumer market and contains applications for
      creating and using multimedia; the home editions consequentally cannot
      join a Windows Server domain. For businesses, there are three editions as
      well. Windows Vista Business is specifically designed for small and
      medium-sized enterprises, while Windows Vista Enterprise is only available
      to Software Assurance customers. Windows Vista Ultimate contains all
      features from the Home and Business editions, as well as Windows Ultimate
      Extras. In the European Union, Home Basic N and Business N variants
      without Windows Media Player are also available due to sanctions brought
      against Microsoft for violating anti-monopoly laws; similar sanctions
      exist in South Korea.

    <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
    <p>
      Windows Aero is the new graphical user interface, which Jim Allchin stated
      is an acronym for Authentic, Energetic, Reflective, and Open. Microsoft
      intended the new interface to be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing
      than those of previous Windows versions, and it features advanced visual
      effects such as blurred glass translucencies and dynamic glass reflections
      and smooth window animations. Laptop users report, however, that enabling
      Aero reduces battery life and reduces performance. Windows Aero requires a
      compositing window manager called Desktop Window Manager. It was a
      significant overhaul of the GUI, a bold and ambitious attempt to modernize
      the Windows user interface. It intoduced many new features, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Aero Glass: This was the most prominent feature of Windows Aero, giving
        windows a transluscent, glass-like appearance. It not only enhanced the
        visual appeal but also provided a sense of depth and layering, making
        the interface more intuitive to use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip 3D: This feature allowed users to cycle through open windows in a
        3D stack, providing a visually engaging way to switch between tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Live Taskbar: The taskbar was redesigned to include thumbnails of open
        windows, making it easier to identify and switch between them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Window Snap: This feature allowed users to easily resize and position
        windows on the screen by dragging them to the edges or corners of the
        display.
      </li>
      <li>
        Aero Peek: This feature temporarily minimized all open windows, giving
        users a clear view of the desktop.
      </li>
    </ul>
