    Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and
    user interface with the intention to improve its user experience on tablets,
    where Windows was competing with mobile operating systems such as Android
    and iOS. These changes included a Windows shell and GUI optimised for
    touchscreeen devices, along with a start screen based on Microsoft's new
    Metro design language, integration with online services, the Windows Store,
    and a new keyboard shortcut for screenshots. Many of these features were
    adapted from Windows Phone. Windows 8 also added support for USB 3.0,
    Advanced Format, near-field communication, and cloud computing, as well as a
    new lock screen with clock and notifications. Additional security
    features—including built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft
    SmartScreen phishing filtering, and support for Secure Boot on supported
    devices—were introduced. It was the first Windows version to support ARM
    architecture under the Windows RT branding. CPUs without PAE, SSE2 and NX
    are unsupported in this version.
  </p>

  <p>
    Windows 8 received a mostly negative reception. Although the reaction to its
    performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for
    touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface was widely
    criticized as confusing and unintuitive, especially when used with a
    keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen. Even then, 60 million licenses
    were sold through January 2013, including upgrades and sales to OEMs for new
    PCs.

    <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
    <p>
      Development started in 2009 while Microsoft was finishing work on Windows
      7. In January 2011, it was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show that
      Windows 8 would add support for ARM System-on-Chips alongside the existing
      32-bit processors produced by vendors, especially AMD and Intel. Windows
      division president Steven Sinofsky demonstrated an early build of the OS
      on prototype devices, while Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the
      company's goal for Windows to be "everywhere on every kind of device
      without compromise." Details also began to surface about a new application
      framework for Windows 8 codenamed "Jupiter", which would be used to make
      "immersive" applications using XAML (similarly to Windows Phone and
      Silverlight) that could be distributed through a new packaging system and
      a rumored application store.
    </p>

    <p>
      The earliest available build of Windows 8 is build 7700, which was
      compiled in January 2010. It was almost identical to Windows 7 except for
      the wallpaper being different—the same one from the Beta and Release
      Candidate. In addition, there were a few references to Windows 8 in this
      build's Local Group Policy Editor Utility. Two milestone releases of
      Windows 8 (builds 7850 and 7955) and one milestone release of Windows
      Server 2012 (build 7959) was leaked to the general public.
      <b>Milestone 1, Build 7850</b>, was built on September 22, 2010 and leaked
      on April 12, 2011. The leaked copy was Enterprise edition, and other
      editions leaked later. It was discovered that Metro existed in this build,
      in 2020, after disabling the Redpill feature lockout. The start screen was
      primitive, a screen with a white background and gray tiles. The charms bar
      was included, but was unusable. The OS still reads "Windows 7".
      <b>Milestone 2, Build 7955</b>, was leaked on April 25, 2011. The
      traditional Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) was replaced by a new black
      screen, but was later reverted to a different blue color. This build
      introduced a new ribbon in Windows Explorer. The "Windows 7" logo was
      temporarily replaced with text displaying "Microsoft Confidential". Both
      builds 7850 and 7955 leaked alongside Windows Server 2012 build 7959. On
      June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition was leaked. It introduced a new
      boot screen featuring the same Betta fish as the default Windows 7 Beta
      wallpaper, which was later replaced, and the circling dots as featured in
      the final build (although the final version comes with smaller circling
      dots). It also had the text Welcome below them, which was scrapped.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <p>
      New features and functionality in Windows 8 include a faster startup
      through UEFI integration and the new "Hybrid Boot" mode (which hibernates
      the Windows kernel on shutdown to speed up the subsequent boot), a new
      lock screen with a clock and notifications, and the ability for enterprise
      users to create live USB variants of Windows (also known as Windows To
      Go). It also includes native support for USB 3 devices, which allow for
      faster data transfers and improved power management with compatible
      devices, and hard disk 4KB Advanced Format support, as well as support for
      near field communication to facilitate sharing and communication between
      devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows Explorer, which has been renamed to File Explorer, now includes a
      ribbon in place of the command bar. File operation dialog boxes have been
      updated to provide more detailed statistics, the ability to pause file
      transfers, and improvements in the ability to manage conflicts when
      copying files. A new "File History" function allows incremental revisions
      of files to be backed up to and restored from a secondary storage device,
      while Storage Spaces allows users to combine different sized hard disks
      into virtual drives and specify mirroring, parity, or no redundancy on a
      folder-by-folder basis. For easier management of files and folders,
      Windows 8 introduces the ability to move selected files or folders via
      drag and drop from a parent folder into a subfolder listed within the
      breadcrumb hierarchy of the address bar in File Explorer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Task Manager has been redesigned, including a new processes tab with the
      option to display fewer or more details of running applications and
      background processes, a heat map using different colors indicating the
      level of resource usage, network and disk counters, grouping by process
      type (e.g. applications, background processes and Windows processes),
      friendly names for processes and a new option which allows users to search
      the web to find information about obscure processes. Additionally, the
      Blue Screen of Death has been updated with a simpler and modern design
      with less technical information displayed.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Safety and security</summary>
      <p>
        New security features in Windows 8 include two new authentication
        methods tailored towards touchscreens (PINs and picture passwords), the
        addition of antivirus capabilities to Windows Defender (bringing it in
        parity with Microsoft Security Essentials). SmartScreen filtering
        integrated into Windows, Family Safety offers parental controls, which
        allows parents to monitor and manage their children's activities on a
        device with activity reports and safety controls. Windows 8 also
        provides integrated system recovery through the new "Refresh" and
        "Reset" functions, including system recovery from USB drive. Windows 8's
        first security patches would be released on November 13, 2012; it would
        contain three fixes deemed "critical" by the company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 8 supports a feature of the UEFI specification known as "Secure
        boot", which uses a public-key infrastructure to verify the integrity of
        the operating system and prevent unauthorized programs such as bootkits
        from infecting the device's boot process. Some pre-built devices may be
        described as "certified" by Microsoft; these must have secure boot
        enabled by default, and provide ways for users to disable or
        re-configure the feature. ARM-based Windows RT devices must have secure
        boot permanently enabled.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Online services and functionality</summary>
      <p>
        Windows 8 provides tighter integration with online services from
        Microsoft and others. A user can now log into Windows with a Microsoft
        account, which can be used to access services and synchronize
        applications and settings between multiple devices. A client app for
        Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud storage service allows apps to save files
        directly to SkyDrive. However, a SkyDrive client for the desktop and
        File Explorer is not included in Windows 8, and must be downloaded
        separately. Bundled multimedia apps are provided under the Xbox brand,
        including Xbox Music, Xbox Video, and the Xbox SmartGlass companion for
        use with an Xbox 360 console. Games can integrate into an Xbox Live hub
        app, which also allows users to view their profile and Gamerscore. Other
        bundled apps provide the ability to link Flickr and Facebook. Due to
        Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in all
        bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.
      </p>

      <p>
        Internet Explorer 10 is included as two variants – a desktop program and
        a touch-optimized app. It also includes increased support for HTML5,
        CSS3, and hardware acceleration. The app does not support plugins or
        ActiveX components, but includes a variant of Adobe Flash Player that is
        optimized for touch and low-power usage. Initially, Adobe Flash would
        only work on sites included on a "Compatibility View" whitelist;
        however, after feedback from users and additional compatibility tests,
        an update in March 2013 changed this behavior to use a smaller blacklist
        of sites with known compatibility issues instead, allowing Flash to be
        used with most sites by default. The desktop variant does not contain
        these limitations.v
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 8 also incorporates improved support for mobile broadband; the
        operating system can now detect the insertion of a SIM card and
        automatically configure connection settings (including APNs and carrier
        branding), and reduce its Internet usage to conserve bandwidth on
        metered networks. An integrated airplane mode setting enables users to
        globally disable all wireless connectivity. Carriers can also offer
        account management systems through Windows Store apps, which can be
        automatically installed as a part of the connection process and offer
        usage statistics on their respective tile.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Windows Store apps</summary>
      <p>
        Windows 8 introduces a new style of application, Windows Store apps.
        According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris, these apps are optimized
        for touchscreen environments and are more specialized than current
        desktop applications. Apps can run either in a full-screen mode or be
        snapped to the side of a screen. Apps can provide toast notifications on
        screen or animate their tiles on the Start screen with dynamic content.
        Apps can use "contracts"; a collection of hooks to provide common
        functionality that can integrate with other apps, including search and
        sharing. Apps can also provide integration with other services; for
        example, the People app can connect to a variety of different social
        networks and services (such as Facebook, Skype, and People service),
        while the Photos app can aggregate photos from services such as Facebook
        and Flickr.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows Store apps run within a new set of APIs known as Windows
        Runtime, which supports programming languages such as C, C++, Visual
        Basic .NET, C#, along with HTML5 and JavaScript. If written in some
        "high-level" languages, apps written for Windows Runtime can be
        compatible with both Intel and ARM variants of Windows, otherwise they
        are not binary code compatible. Components may be compiled as Windows
        Runtime Components, permitting their use by all compatible languages. To
        ensure stability and security, apps run within a sandboxed environment,
        and require permissions to use certain other functionalities, such as
        accessing the Internet or a camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Retail variants of Windows 8 are only able to install these apps through
        Windows Store – a namesake distribution platform that offers both apps,
        and listings for desktop programs certified for comparability with
        Windows 8. A method to sideload apps from outside Windows Store is
        available to devices running Windows 8 Enterprise and joined to a
        domain; Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT devices that are not part of a
        domain can also sideload apps, but only after special product keys are
        obtained through volume licensing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The term "Immersive app" had been used internally by Microsoft
        developers to refer to the apps prior to the first official presentation
        of Windows 8, after which they were referred to as "Metro-style apps" in
        reference to the Metro design language. The term was phased out in
        August 2012; a Microsoft spokesperson denied rumors that the change was
        related to a potential trademark issue, and stated that "Metro" was only
        a codename that would be replaced prior to Windows 8's release.
        Following these reports, the terms "Modern UI-style apps", "Windows
        8-style apps", and "Windows Store apps" began to be used in various
        Microsoft documents and material to refer to the new apps. In an
        interview on September 12, 2012, Soma Somasegar (vice president of
        Microsoft's development software division) confirmed that "Windows Store
        apps" would be the official term for the apps. An MSDN page explaining
        the Metro design language uses the term "Modern design" to refer to the
        language as a whole.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Web browsers</summary>

      <p>
        Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given to
        web browsers. The user's default browser can distribute a Metro-style
        web browser in the same package as the desktop variant, which has access
        to functionality unavailable to other apps, such as being able to
        permanently run in the background, use multiple background processes,
        and use Windows API code instead of WinRT (allowing for code to be
        re-used with the desktop variant, while still taking advantage of
        features available to Windows Store apps, such as charms). Microsoft
        advertises this exception privilege "New experience enabled" (formerly
        "Metro-style enabled").
      </p>

      <p>
        The developers of both Chrome and Firefox committed to developing
        Metro-style variants of their browsers; while Chrome's "Windows 8 mode"
        (discontinued on Chrome version 49) uses a full-screen version of the
        existing desktop interface, Firefox's variant (which was first made
        available on the "Aurora" release channel in September 2013) uses a
        touch-optimized interface inspired by the Android variant of Firefox. In
        October 2013, Chrome's app was changed to mimic the desktop environment
        used by ChromeOS. Development of the Firefox app for Windows 8 has since
        been cancelled, citing a lack of user adoption of the beta versions.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Removed features</summary>
      <p>
        Several notable features were removed in Windows 8; support for playing
        DVD-Video was removed from Windows Media Player due to the cost of
        licensing the necessary decoders (especially for devices which do not
        include optical disc drives at all) and the prevalence of online
        streaming services. For the same reasons, Windows Media Center is not
        included by default on Windows 8, but Windows Media Center and DVD
        playback support could be purchased in the "Pro Pack" (which upgrades
        the system to Windows 8 Pro) or the "Media Center Pack" add-on for
        Windows 8 Pro. As with prior versions, third-party DVD player software
        can still be used to enable DVD playback.
      </p>

      <p>
        Backup and Restore, the backup component of Windows, was deprecated. It
        still shipped with Windows 8 and continues to work on preset schedules,
        but it was pushed to the background and can only be accessed through a
        Control Panel applet called "Windows 7 File Recovery".  Shadow Copy, a
        component of Windows Explorer that once saved previous versions of
        changed files, no longer protects local files and folders. It can only
        access previous versions of shared files stored on a Windows Server
        computer.  The subsystem on which these components worked, however, is
        still available for other software to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Support for older XPDM and VGA display adapter drivers was removed in
        favor of heightened kernel stability, GPU scheduling performance and
        security.

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 8 is available in three different editions, of which only the base
      edition, branded simply as Windows 8, and Windows 8 Pro, were sold at
      retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers.
      Each edition of Windows 8 includes all of the capabilities and features of
      the edition preceding it, and add additional features oriented towards
      their market segments. Windows 8 was distributed as a retail box product
      on DVD, and through a digital download that could be converted into DVD or
      USB install media. From its launch until January 31, 2013, as part of a
      launch promotion, Microsoft offered Windows 8 Pro upgrades at a discounted
      price of US$39.99 online, or $69.99 for a retail box; afterward the
      Windows 8 price has been $119.99 and the Pro price $199.99. Those who
      purchased new PCs pre-loaded with Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium,
      Professional, or Ultimate between June 2, 2012, and January 31, 2013,
      could digitally purchase a Windows 8 Pro upgrade for US$14.99. Several PC
      manufacturers offered rebates and refunds on Windows 8 upgrades obtained
      through promotions on select models, such as those of Hewlett-Packard (in
      the U.S. and Canada on select models) and Acer (in Europe on selected
      Ultrabook models). During these promotions, the Windows Media Center
      add-on for Windows 8 Pro was also offered for free. Unlike previous
      versions of Windows, Windows 8 was distributed at retail only under
      "Upgrade" licenses, which require a previous version of Windows to
      install. The "full version software" SKU, which was more expensive but
      could be installed on computers without an eligible OS or none at all, was
      discontinued. In lieu of a full version, a specialized "System Builder"
      SKU was introduced. The "System Builder" replaced the original equipment
      manufacturer (OEM) SKU, which was only allowed for use on PCs meant for
      resale but added a "Personal Use License" exemption that officially
      allowed its purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers.
      Retail distribution of Windows 8 has since been discontinued in favor of
      Windows 8.1. Unlike Windows 8, 8.1 is available as "full version software"
      as both a packaged DVD and online for download, and does not require a
      previous version of Windows in order to be installed. Pricing for these
      new copies remains identical with that of Windows 8. With the retail
      release of Windows 8.1 returning to being full version software, the
      "Personal Use License" exemption was removed from the OEM SKU, meaning
      that end users building their own PCs for personal use must use the full
      retail variant in order to satisfy the Windows 8.1 licensing requirements.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 8 introduces significant changes to the operating system's user
      interface, many of which are aimed at improving its experience on tablet
      computers and other touchscreen devices. The new user interface is based
      on Microsoft's Metro design language and uses a Start screen similar to
      that of Windows Phone 7 as the primary means of launching applications.
      The Start screen displays a customizable array of tiles linking to various
      apps and desktop programs, some of which can display constantly updated
      information and content through "live tiles". As a form of multi-tasking,
      apps can be snapped to the side of a screen. Alongside the traditional
      Control Panel, a new simplified and touch-optimized settings app known as
      "PC Settings" is used for basic configuration and user settings. It does
      not include many of the advanced options still accessible from the Control
      Panel.
    </p>

    <p>
      A vertical toolbar known as the charms (accessed by swiping from the right
      edge of a touchscreen, swiping from the right edge of a touchpad, or
      pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) provides
      access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing,
      device management, settings, and a Start button. The traditional desktop
      environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the
      Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of
      Windows has been converted into a hotspot (or "hot corner") in the
      lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying
      a thumbnail of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 added the start button back
      to the taskbar after many complaints, but removed the preview thumbnail.
      Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left
      corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop.
      Pointing the cursor at the top-left corner of the screen and moving down
      reveals a thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the
      Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter
      and solid-colored design (Metro-style UI), the desktop interface on
      Windows 8 is similar to that of Windows 7.
