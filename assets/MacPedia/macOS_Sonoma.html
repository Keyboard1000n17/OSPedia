<p>
  macOS Sonoma was succeeded by macOS Sequoia, which was released on September

</p>
<p>
  The first developer beta was released on June 5, 2023, and macOS Sonoma
  entered public beta on July 11, 2023.
</p>
<p>
  Sonoma is the final version of macOS that supports the 2018-2019 MacBook Air,
  as its successor, macOS Sequoia, drops support for those models.
</p>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Sonoma supports Macs with Apple silicon and Intel's Xeon-W and
    8th-generation Coffee Lake/Amber Lake chips or later, and drops support for
    various models released in 2017, officially marking the end of support for
    Macs without Retina display and the 12-inch MacBook. The 2019 iMac is the
    only Sonoma-supported Intel Mac that lacks a T2 chip.
  </p>
  <p>Mac models that support macOS Sonoma are as follows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (2019 and later)</li>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (2018 and later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (2018 and later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (2018 and later)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (2019 and later)</li>
    <li>Mac Studio (all models)</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Unofficial support</span>
  <p>
    By using patch tools such as OpenCore Legacy Patcher, macOS Sonoma can be
    unofficially installed on earlier models that are officially unsupported.
    Such models date back to the 2008 MacBook Pro and 2007 iMac.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to an Ars Technica analysis, 2016 and 2017 Macs received on
    average six years of updates, lower than the seven to eight years of updates
    received by Intel Macs released from 2009 to 2015.

  <summary class="level-one">New features and changes</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Sonoma includes a number of new features and improvements, mainly
    focused on productivity and creativity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Widgets have been revamped. They are no longer constrained to the
      Notification Center - instead they can be placed anywhere on the desktop,
      and the widget picker has been redesigned to resemble the iOS and iPadOS
      versions of it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The lock screen has been redesigned to include a date and time similar to
      iOS and iPadOS. The power buttons have become a context menu.
    </li>
    <li>
      Video-conferencing apps can overlay the presenter's webcam video on top of
      screen sharing.
    </li>
    <li>App icons have been made more rounded.</li>
    <li>
      The Spotlight search bar has been made more rounded, and its width has
      been decreased.
    </li>
    <li>Safari changes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Browsing profiles enable separate sets of bookmarks, extensions, and
        cookies, which can be used to separate, for example, a personal setup
        from a work one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Password sharing lets multiple people have access to the same collection
        of website passwords, and update them as needed, with changes syncing
        across all enrolled devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Safari web apps let the user add any website to the Dock and open it in
        a simplified Safari interface, in a way that is similar to both web apps
        introduced in iPhone OS 1.1.3 and Google Chrome. This feature is
        slightly different from progressive web apps since it does not require
        additional work from website developers.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Messages changes:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        More precise search filters: for example, the contact name can be
        combined with a search term to look for the term within a specific
        conversation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Catch-up lets the user quickly jump to the first unread message in a
        conversation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tapback now appears as multiple icons instead of being a context menu.
      </li>
      <li>iMessage stickers have a new selection interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Apple TV now has a sidebar instead of a top bar.</li>
    <li>
      Game mode optimizes gaming performance by prioritizing gaming tasks and
      allocating more GPU and CPU capacity to the game. It provides smoother
      frame rates for game play and reduced latency for Bluetooth peripherals,
      such as wireless game controllers and AirPods.
    </li>
    <li>
      New slow-motion screensavers of different locations worldwide. When logged
      in, they gradually slow down and become the desktop wallpaper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Smoother animations for several areas such as the notification panel, the
      lock screen, and the show desktop gesture. The notifications now slide in
      with an ease-out motion, the lock screen now zooms in and out when
      unlocking and locking, the show desktop gesture has a new spring back
      animation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Users can react with their hands and animations will pop up based on the
      hand gesture.
    </li>
    <li>
      AV1 hardware decoding has been introduced on devices with AV1 hardware
      decoding support, such as Macs with SoCs from the Apple M3 family.
    </li>
    <li>
      Print Center, a utility application returning from Mac OS X Tiger, was
      reintroduced for managing print jobs, viewing different printer queues,
      and pausing or deleting print jobs.
    </li>
    <li>
      The text cursor now looks more like its iOS counterpart. It is bolder, has
      a smooth blinking motion, and its color follows the current app's accent
      color. It also briefly displays an indicator that shows the current input
      language when the user switches keyboard languages. This indicator can
      also signal helpful input details like when Caps Lock is on.
    </li>
    <li>
      Videos now encode faster in Final Cut Pro, Compressor, and third-party
      video applications on Mac computers using M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra.
    </li>
    <li>
      The startup screen is now slightly different, with the loading bar at the
      bottom being lowered to the bottom of the screen instead of immediately
      under the Apple logo.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Gaming</span>
  <p>
    Alongside macOS Sonoma, Apple announced developer tools for porting Windows
    games to macOS. The Game Porting Toolkit (GPTK), derived from Wine and
    Crossover and released in beta, translates Windows application programming
    interface (API) calls to equivalent macOS APIs, allowing developers to run
    unmodified versions of their x86 Windows DirectX games on macOS. Mac users
    have been able to use the Game Porting Toolkit to run a number of DirectX 12
    games; tech news outlets have compared the tool to Valve Corporation's
    Proton compatibility layer for Linux. Apple also released a Metal Shader
    Converter that converts shaders to Apple's Metal graphics API.
  </p>
  <p>
    A DigitalFoundry review of the first beta of Game Porting Toolkit found it
    "impressive", with few graphical glitches and full support for console
    controllers instead of the keyboard, though they found that frame rates were
    around half of what they would be on Windows, and that many games were not
    supported. During the Sonoma beta, updates to the Game Porting Toolkit
    brought support for 32-bit games and around 20% better performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Writing for AppleInsider and iMore, reporter Peter Cohen said that Game Mode
    and the Game Porting Toolkit are improvements but do not indicate the kind
    of "sea change" in Apple's priorities and culture that are needed to build a
    true Mac gaming ecosystem. Cohen says that the problem with Mac gaming is
    not in the ability to port games, but in a lack of a "business case" for
    game publishers to do so, due to the Mac's low market share, the cost of
    supporting a port, and uncertain demand for Mac games when many Mac users
    also own consoles or gaming PCs. YouTuber Snazzy Labs issued similar
    criticisms, which journalist John Siracusa agreed with.
  </p>
  <span class="level-two">New Unicode Characters Font Support</span>
  <p>macOS 14.0 introduced support for the following Unicode characters:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tagalog Letter Ra (U+170D) (14.0)</li>
    <li>Tagalog Sign Pamudpod (U+1715) (14.0)</li>
    <li>Tagalog Letter Archaic Ra (U+171F) (14.0)</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for legacy Mail plug-ins has been removed.</li>
    <li>
      System API support for converting PostScript and Encapsulated PostScript
      files to PDF format has been removed, following previous changes in macOS
      Ventura that removed support for viewing and converting PostScript and
      Encapsulated PostScript files within Preview.
