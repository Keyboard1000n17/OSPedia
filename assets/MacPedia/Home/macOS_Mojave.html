<p>
  macOS Mojave (pronounced mo-HAH-vee) is the fifteenth major release of macOS,
  Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. macOS Mojave
  was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 4, 2018, and
  was released to the public on September 24. The operating system's name refers
  to the Mojave Desert, continuing the use of California-themed names that began
  with OS X Mavericks. It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was followed by macOS
  Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that features the iTunes
  and Dashboard apps.

  macOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system,
  including Apple News, Voice Memos, and Home. It also includes a more
  comprehensive "dark mode", is the final version of macOS to support 32-bit
  application software, is the last version of the macOS capable of being booted
  from an HFS+ partition without third-party patching, and is also the last
  version of macOS to support the iPhoto app, which had already been superseded
  in OS X Yosemite (10.10) by the newer Photos app.
</p>
<p>
  macOS Mojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases after
  launch.

  <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Mojave requires a GPU that supports Metal, and the list of
    officially-compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous version,
    macOS High Sierra. Mojave drops support for various Macs released from late
    2009 to 2011. Compatible models are the following Macintosh computers
    running OS X Mountain Lion or later:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>
      Mac Pro (2013, 2010-2012 supported with a Metal-capable graphics card)/li>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    macOS Mojave requires at least 2 GB of RAM as well as 12.5 GB of available
    disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High
    Sierra, or 18.5 GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X Yosemite and earlier
    releases. Some features are not available on all compatible models. Mojave
    installations convert the installation volume to Apple File System (APFS),
    if the volume had not previously been converted from HFS+.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <span class="level-two">System updates</span>
  <p>
    macOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS. The
    graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the operating
    system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are encouraged to use
    Apple's Metal library instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide
    range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support
    for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D.
    At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing
    libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs.
    As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware
    platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized
    hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the "bare
    metal". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces
    driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to
    send commands to the GPU.
  </p>
  <p>
    macOS does not natively support Vulkan, the Khronos group's official
    successor to OpenGL. The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge,
    translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continuing the process started in macOS High Sierra (10.13), which issued
    warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave issues
    warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported in future
    updates. In macOS Mojave 10.14, this alert appears once every 30 days when
    launching the app, as macOS 10.15 will not support 32-bit applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Mojave is installed, it will convert solid-state drives (SSDs), hard
    disk drives (HDDs), and Fusion Drives, from HFS Plus to APFS. On Fusion
    Drives using APFS, files will be moved to the SSD based on the file's
    frequency of use and its SSD performance profile. APFS will also store all
    metadata for a Fusion Drive's file system on the SSD.
  </p>
  <p>
    New data protections require applications to get permission from the user
    before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data like
    user Mail history and Messages database.
  </p>
  <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Mojave removes integrations with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vimeo, and
      Flickr, which were added in OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mojave also removes support for sub-pixel rendering of text. The feature
      was previously used on non-Retina displays to improve the appearance of
      text on screen.
    </li>
    <li>
      The only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K5000 and GeForce
      GTX 680 Mac Edition.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Applications</span>
  <p>
    Mojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones. Finder
    now has metadata preview accessed via View > Show Preview, and many other
    updates, including a Gallery View (replacing Cover Flow) that lets users
    browse through files visually. After a screenshot is taken, the image
    appears in the corner of the display, as with iOS. The screenshot software
    can now record video, choose where to save files, and be opened via
    <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Safari's Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media "Like" or
    "Share" buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission.
    The browser also sends less information to web servers about the user's
    system, reducing the chance of being tracked based on system configuration.
    It can also automatically create, autofill, and store strong passwords when
    users create new online accounts; it also flags reused passwords so users
    can change them.
  </p>
  <p>
    A new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app.
    Screenshot can capture a selected area, window or the entire screen as well
    as screen record a selected area or the entire display. The Screenshot app
    is located in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder, as was the Grab app.
    Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing
    <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>.
  </p>
  <p>
    macOS 10.14.1, released on October 30, 2018, adds Group FaceTime, which lets
    users chat with up to 32 people at the same time, using video or audio from
    an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or audio from Apple Watch. Participants can join in
    mid-conversation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new
    interface and editorial content, similar to the iOS App Store. A new
    'Discover' tab highlights new and updated apps; Create, Work, Play and
    Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    Four new apps (News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home) are ported to macOS
    Mojave from iOS, with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the desktop
    OS. Third-party developers would be able to port iOS applications to macOS
    in 2019.
  </p>
  <p>
    With Home, Mac users can control their HomeKit-enabled accessories to do
    things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings. Voice
    Memos lets users record audio (e.g., personal notes, lectures, meetings,
    interviews, or song ideas), and access them from iPhone, iPad or Mac. Stocks
    delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist, with quotes
    and charts.
  </p>
  <p>A few security fixes were made.</p>

    Mojave revamps Dark Mode. A light-on-dark color scheme, it initially
    affected only the dock, menu bar, and drop-down menus, while here, it
    darkens the entire user interface to make content stand out while the
    interface recedes. Users can choose dark or light mode when installing
    Mojave, or any time thereafter from System Preferences. All of the built-in
    apps support the revamp. App developers can implement the feature in their
    apps via a public API.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stacks, a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard, now lets users group
    desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind, date
    last opened, date modified, date created, name and tags. This is accessed
    via View > Use Stacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    macOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes
    specially made desktop backgrounds (two of which are included) to match the
    time of day.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously been
    added to the Dock.
  </p>
  <p>
    macOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences from
    the Mac App Store. In OS X Mountain Lion (10.8), system and app updates
    moved to the App Store from Software Update.
