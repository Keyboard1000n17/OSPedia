    </p>
    <p>
      macOS Sierra (version 10.12) is the thirteenth major release of macOS
      (formerly known as OS X and Mac OS X), Apple Inc.'s desktop and server
      operating system for Macintosh computers. The name "macOS" stems from the
      intention to unify the operating system's name with that of iOS, watchOS
      and tvOS. Sierra is named after the Sierra Nevada mountain range in
      California and Nevada. Specifically, Lone Pine Peak is the location for
      macOS Sierra's default wallpaper. Its major new features concern
      Continuity, iCloud, and windowing, as well as support for Apple Pay and
      Siri.

    <p>
      The first beta of macOS Sierra was released to developers shortly
      following the 2016 WWDC keynote on June 13, 2016. The first public-beta
      release followed on July 7, 2016. It was released to end users on
      September 20, 2016, as a free upgrade through the Mac App Store and it was
      succeeded by macOS High Sierra on September 25, 2017.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-one">Systen Requirements</summary>
      <p>
        macOS Sierra requires at least 2 GB of RAM and 8 GB of storage space and
        is designed to run on the following products:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>iMac (Late 2009 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook (Late 2009 or later)</li>
        <li>>MacBook Air (Late 2010 or later)</li>
        <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
        <li>Mac Mini (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
        <li>>Mac Pro (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sierra dropped support for various Macs released from mid 2007 to mid
        2009, the first version of macOS since OS X Mountain Lion, released in
        2012, to do so. Support for Xserve was also dropped in Sierra.
      </p>
      <span class="level-two">Workarounds for unsupported systems</span>
      <p>
        Some developers have created workarounds to install macOS Sierra on
        certain Mac computers that are no longer officially supported as long as
        they are packed with a CPU that supports SSE4.1. This requires using a
        patch to modify the install image.
      </p>

      <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
      <span class="level-two">System features</span>
      <div class="div-level-two">
        <span class="level-three">Siri</span>
        <p>
          The user can access the Siri intelligent assistant via the Dock, the
          menu bar or a keyboard shortcut and results are shown in a window in
          the upper-right corner. Siri can send messages, search the web, find
          files and adjust settings. Results can be dropped into other
          applications or pinned to Notification Center. For instance, pictures
          from search results can be dragged into a document.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">iCloud Drive and Optimized Storage</span>
        <p>
          iCloud Drive can upload the user's documents and desktop directories
          and sync them to other devices. The System Information application has
          a new section that gives the user detailed information about space
          usage per application or file and provides tools and suggestions for
          freeing up space. For instance, the user can let the system upload old
          files to iCloud Drive and remove their local copies, keeping them
          available on-demand in Finder. It can also remove old files from trash
          automatically. iTunes can delete watched, purchased films and TV
          programs from its library.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Auto Unlock and Universal Clipboard</span>
        <p>
          Building upon Continuity, an "umbrella term [for] features that
          facilitate the communication between [Apple devices]" using Bluetooth
          and Wi-Fi, Sierra adds two features. With Auto Unlock, the user can
          unlock their user account by holding a paired Apple Watch close to the
          device. Time of flight is used to prevent relay attacks. Auto Unlock
          requires a Mac that was introduced in 2013 or later. With Universal
          Clipboard, the user can share the clipboard for cut, copy and paste
          between macOS Sierra and iOS 10 devices, including text and rich
          content, such as pictures or videos.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Tabs and Picture-in-Picture</span>
        <p>
          Applications that support multiple windows can support multiple tabs
          within a single window, allowing the user to keep windows organized
          similarly to Safari. With Picture-in-Picture, videos can be played in
          a window that follows the user across the system.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Apple File System</span>
        <p>
          Apple released a preview of a new file system in Sierra, called Apple
          File System (APFS), to overcome the limitations of HFS Plus. APFS is
          intended for solid-state drives and flash memory and adopts several
          features found in modern file systems, such as snapshots and cloning,
          as well as native support for features that Apple already provides in
          HFS Plus through supplementary software, such as file-system
          encryption and TRIM support. The file system was released in macOS
          High Sierra.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Night Shift</span>
        <p>
          Night Shift is new in macOS 10.12.4, with the same functionality as
          its iOS counterpart. Night Shift reduces blue light at night to aid
          sleep. This can be scheduled in the System Preferences app (in the
          Displays menu) and can be toggled on or off in the Notification Center
          or using Siri.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since this feature relies on the Metal framework, Night Shift is not
          available on all systems that support macOS Sierra.
        </p>
      </div>
      <span class="level-two">Application features</span>
      <div class="div-level-two">
        <span class="level-three">Photos</span>
        <p>
          Apple says it has improved the face recognition of the Photos
          application, adding object and scene recognition. It groups similar
          pictures together using faces, locations and object recognition to
          create "memories". Memories contain picture slideshows with
          transitions and music selected by the algorithm, which can be modified
          to the user's liking. The "People" album organizes photos by the
          people in them, and Places shows all photos on a world map.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Safari and Apple Pay</span>
        <p>
          Safari provides an "extension point" which enables developers to
          bundle Safari extensions within their Cocoa applications and
          communicate with them directly from the applications. Safari conceals
          the presence of installed "legacy" plug-ins, such as Adobe Flash
          Player, Java applets, Microsoft Silverlight, and QuickTime - from
          websites and requires the user to enable a specific plug-in on a
          per-use or per-website basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apple Pay allows vendors to embed an Apple Pay button on their
          websites. In Safari, users can click the Apple Pay button to check
          out, then complete a purchase using an iPhone or Apple Watch. Apple
          Pay requires a Mac that supports Continuity (2012 or later models) and
          either an iPhone 6 or later with iOS 10, or an Apple Watch with
          watchOS 3.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Messages</span>
        <p>
          The Messages app adds aesthetic effects to messages, such as three
          times bigger emojis and click back with hearts or thumbs-up on a
          message bubble. The ability to play YouTube videos and preview links
          in a conversation was introduced. Users can view interactive content
          added to iMessage in iOS 10. The app also allows you to turn on or off
          read receipts on a conversation by conversation basis.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">iTunes</span>
        <p>
          Apple Music within iTunes has been redesigned, making it simpler to
          find favorite songs and discover new ones. A new "For You" tab has
          been added, which suggests new music the user might like (similar to
          the existing Genius). A refined MiniPlayer with the ability to view
          lyrics while listening has also been introduced.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
        <p>
          The Notes app allows the user to share and collaborate on notes. This
          is done by clicking on a share button at the top of the window.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Other changes</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Disk Utility regains the ability to format and manage RAID sets,
            after it was removed in El Capitan.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finder has an option to show folders always at the top of the view
            hierarchy, for instance in list views.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mail adds a control to the top of email lists to quickly filter
            them, for instance, by read status or the presence of attachments.
          </li>
          <li>
            13 & 15-inch Retina MacBook Pros now default to integer scaled over
            nearest-neighbor scaled resolutions to fit more content.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <span class="level-two">Security improvements</span>
      <div class="div-level-two">
        <span class="level-three">Gatekeeper</span>
        <p>
          macOS Sierra slightly changes the Gatekeeper user interface and adds
          two new mechanisms. A new default in System Preferences hides the
          "Anywhere" option which allows the user to disable the mechanism and
          execute programs from any source without needing to approve each new
          one individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first new mechanism allows developers to code-sign disk images
          that can be verified as a unit by the system. This allows developers
          to guarantee the integrity of external files that are distributed
          alongside the application bundle on the same disk image. An attacker
          could infect these external files with malicious code and with them
          exploit a vulnerability in the application, without having to break
          the signature of the application bundle itself. By signing the disk
          image, the developer can prevent tampering and force an attacker to
          repackage the files onto a new disk image, requiring a valid developer
          certificate to pass Gatekeeper without a warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second new mechanism is "path randomization", which executes
          application bundles from a random, hidden path and prevents them from
          accessing external files relative to their location. To avoid this,
          the developer has to distribute the application bundle and its
          external files on a signed disk image or in a signed installer
          package. The user can avoid this mechanism by moving the application
          bundle without its external files to a new location.
        </p>
        <span class="level-three">Directory permissions and sudo</span>
        <p>
          The Unix permissions for writing to the
          <code>/Volumes</code> directory are now restricted to root and no
          longer "world-writable". Apple expanded System Integrity Protection to
          <code>/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC</code>, a directory
          that contains a list of applications that are allowed to "control the
          computer", and restricts write access to programs which were signed
          with an Apple "private entitlement". The file-hosting service Dropbox
          has been criticized for manipulating the directory to add their
          Dropbox application to the list, rather than asking the user to do it
          for them explicitly in System Preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sudo command-line utility with which a user can execute a command
          as another user, typically as root, is configured with the
          "tty_tickets" flag by default, restricting the session timeout to the
          terminal session (such as a window or tab) in which the user
          authenticated the program.
        </p>
      </div>
      <span class="level-two">Removed functionality</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Sierra removes support for garbage collection from the Objective-C
          runtime, a memory-management system that was added in Mac OS X Leopard
          (version 10.5) and declared deprecated in favor of Automatic Reference
          Counting in OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8). Applications that have
          been compiled with garbage collection will no longer run.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apple removed native support for the VPN protocol PPTP and made
          recommendations for alternatives that it considers more secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          The battery's "time remaining" estimate was removed in the 10.12.2
          update after complaints of the battery life of 2016 MacBook Pros.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Game Center app has been removed. However, the service still
          exists.
