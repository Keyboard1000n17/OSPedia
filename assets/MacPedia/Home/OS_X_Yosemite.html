  OS X Yosemite was announced and released to developers on June 2, 2014, at
  WWDC 2014 and released to public beta testers on July 24, 2014. Yosemite was
  released to consumers on October 16, 2014. Following the Northern California
  landmark-based naming scheme introduced with OS X Mavericks, Yosemite is named
  after the national park.

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    All Macintosh computers capable of running OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8.x) are
    able to run Yosemite as the two operating systems have the same
    requirements. However, to take full advantage of the Handoff feature,
    additional minimum system requirements include a Mac with Bluetooth LE
    (Bluetooth 4.0). As with Mavericks and Mountain Lion, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB of
    available storage, and Mac OS X Snow Leopard 10.6.8 or later are required.
  </p>
  <p>These are the models that are compatible with OS X Yosemite:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Mid 2007 to Mid 2015)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Late 2008 to Mid 2010)</li>
    <li>12-inch MacBook (2015)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 to Early 2015)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 to Mid 2015)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009 to Late 2014)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (Early 2008 to Late 2013)</li>
    <li>Xserve (Early 2009)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These are the models that support new features such as Handoff, Instant
    Hotspot as well as AirDrop between Mac computers and iOS devices:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)</li>

    <summary class="level-two">Design</summary>
    <p>
      Yosemite introduced a major overhaul of OS X's user interface, emphasizing
      flat graphic design over skeuomorphism, following the aesthetic introduced
      with iOS 7 and certain applications from OS X Mavericks. It is the first
      major redesign of the OS X user interface since 10.5 Leopard. Other
      changes include thinner fonts and blurred translucency effects. Some icons
      have been changed to correspond with those of iOS 7 and iOS 8. Yosemite
      maintains the OS X desktop metaphor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other design changes include new icons, light and dark color schemes, and
      the replacement of Lucida Grande with Helvetica Neue as the default system
      typeface. Yosemite is the only macOS version to use Helvetica Neue as the
      default typeface, as in El Capitan it was again changed, this time to
      Apple's own, newly-designed San Francisco typeface. In Yosemite, the Dock
      is a 2D translucent rectangular strip instead of a skeuomorphic glass
      shelf, reminiscent of the Dock design used in early versions of OS X
      through Tiger and in iOS since iOS 7.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Continuity</summary>
    <p>
      Many of Yosemite's new features focus on the theme of "continuity",
      increasing its integration with other Apple platforms and services such as
      iOS and iCloud. The Handoff functionality allows the operating system to
      integrate with iOS 8 devices over Bluetooth LE and Wi-Fi; users can place
      and answer phone calls using their iPhone as a conduit, send and receive
      text messages, activate personal hotspots, or load items being worked on
      in a mobile app (such as Mail drafts or Numbers spreadsheets) directly
      into their desktop equivalent.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Notification Center</summary>
    <p>
      Notification Center features a new "Today" view, similar to that in iOS.
      The Today view can display information and updates from various sources,
      along with widgets. The widgets in the Today view are similar to those of
      iOS 8.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Photos</summary>
    <p>
      As of OS X 10.10.3, Photos replaces both iPhoto and Aperture. It uses
      iCloud Photo Library to upload all the user's photos across their devices.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Other</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spotlight is a more prominent part of the operating system; it now
        displays its search box in the center of the screen and can include
        results from online sources, including Bing, Maps, and Wikipedia. Stock
        applications such as Safari and Mail have been updated. In particular,
        many security features have been added to Safari, such as a custom
        history clearing option that lets users clear history, cookies, and
        other data from the previous hour, day, or two days. In addition, Apple
        added DuckDuckGo to its search offerings, a non-tracking search engine
        that doesn't store users' data. Safari allows you to remotely close tabs
        from an iOS device. Safari now supports browsing in private browsing
        mode with certain windows (as opposed to all the windows having to be
        either in or out of private browsing).
      </li>
      <li>
        The green "zoom" button on windows now has a different function in
        applications that support full-screen mode. Instead of simply enlarging
        the window, the button now enters full-screen mode, eliminating the
        full-screen button at the top-right corner of windows that has been
        present since Mac OS X Lion. However, holding the Option key (‚å•) while
        clicking the zoom button or double-clicking on the window chrome
        continues to invoke the original behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is the new system-wide support for
        scripting with JavaScript, built upon JavaScriptCore and the Open
        Scripting Architecture. It features an Objective-C bridge which enables
        entire Cocoa applications to be programmed in JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        Along with other framework changes, CloudKit was integrated in this
        release. CloudKit functions as a Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS) and
        is one method for app developers to integrate access to Apple's iCloud
        servers into their apps.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a "dark mode" in System Preferences which makes the Dock and
        menu bar darker.
      </li>
    </ul>
