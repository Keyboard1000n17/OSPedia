<p>
  macOS Catalina (version 10.15) is the sixteenth major release of macOS, Apple
  Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. It is the successor
  to macOS Mojave and was announced at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019 and released to
  the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first version of macOS to
  support only 64-bit applications and the first to include Activation Lock. It
  is also the last version of macOS to have the major version number be 10.x;
  its successor, Big Sur, released on November 12, 2020, is version 11. In order
  to increase web compatibility, Safari, Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS
  in the user agent running in subsequent releases of macOS at 10.15.7 Catalina.

<p>
  macOS Catalina is the final version of macOS that supports the Unibody MacBook
  Pro, as its successor, macOS Big Sur, drops support for its mid-2012 and final
  model. The Unibody MacBook Pro was a design of the MacBook Pro used from
  2008-2012.

  <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
  <p>
    All standard configuration Macs that supported macOS Mojave support macOS
    Catalina. 2010 to 2012 Mac Pros, which could run Mojave only with a GPU
    upgrade, are no longer supported. Catalina requires 4 GB of memory, an
    increase over the 2 GB required by Lion through Mojave.

  <p>
    It is unofficially possible to install macOS Catalina on many older
    Macintosh computers that are not officially supported by Apple. This
    requires using a patch to modify the install image. "dosdude1"'s Catalina
    Patcher is an example of those tools, which can be used to Install Catalina
    on machines between 2008 and 2011.

  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <span class="level-two">System</span>
  <div class="div-level-two">
    <span class="level-three">Catalyst</span>
    <p>
      Catalyst is a new software-development tool that allows developers to
      write apps that can run on macOS, iOS and iPadOS. Apple demonstrated
      several ported apps, including Jira and Twitter (after the latter
      discontinued its macOS app in February 2018).
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">System extensions</span>
    <p>
      An upgrade from Kexts. System extensions avoid the problems of Kexts
      (kernel extensions). There are 3 kinds of System extensions: Network
      Extensions, Endpoint Security Extensions, and Driver Extensions. System
      extensions run in userspace, outside of the kernel. Catalina will be the
      last version of macOS to support legacy system extensions.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">DriverKit</span>
    <p>
      A replacement for IOKit device drivers, driver extensions are built using
      DriverKit. DriverKit is a new SDK with all-new frameworks based on IOKit,
      but updated and modernized. It is designed for building device drivers in
      userspace, outside of the kernel.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Gatekeeper</span>
    <p>
      Mac apps, installer packages, and kernel extensions that are signed with a
      Developer ID must be notarized by Apple to run on macOS Catalina.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Activation Lock</span>
    <p>
      Activation Lock helps prevent the unauthorized use and drive erasure of
      devices with an Apple T2 security chip (2018, 2019, and 2020 MacBook Pro;
      2020 5K iMac; 2018 MacBook Air, iMac Pro; 2018 Mac Mini; 2019 Mac Pro).
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Dedicated system volume</span>
    <p>
      The system runs on its own read-only volume, separate from all other data
      on the Mac.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Voice control</span>
    <p>
      Users can give detailed voice commands to applications. On-device machine
      processing is used to offer better navigation.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Sidecar</span>
    <p>
      Sidecar allows a Mac to use an iPad (running iPadOS) as a wireless
      external display. With Apple Pencil, the device can also be used as a
      graphics tablet for software running on the computer. Sidecar requires a
      Mac with Intel Skylake CPUs and newer (such as the fourth-generation
      MacBook Pro), and an iPad that supports Apple Pencil.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Support for wireless game controllers</span>
    <p>
      The Game Controller framework adds support for two major console game
      controllers: the PlayStation 4's DualShock 4 and the Xbox One controller.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Time Machine</span>
    <p>
      A number of under-the-hood changes were made to Time Machine, the backup
      software. For example, the manner in which backup data is stored on
      network-attached devices was changed, and this change is not
      backwards-compatible with earlier versions of macOS. Apple declined to
      document these changes, but some of them have been noted.
    </p>
  </div>
  <span class="level-two">Applications</span>
  <div class="div-level-two">
    <span class="level-three">iTunes</span>
    <p>
      iTunes is replaced by separate Music, Podcasts, TV and Books apps, in line
      with iOS. iOS device management is now conducted via Finder. The TV app on
      Mac supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on MacBooks released in
      2018 or later, while 4K HDR playback is supported on Macs released in 2018
      or later when connected to a compatible display.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Find My</span>
    <p>
      Find My Mac and Find My Friends are merged into an application called Find
      My.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
    <p>
      The Notes application was enhanced to allow better management of
      checklists and the ability to share folders with other users. The
      application version was incremented from 4.6 (in macOS 10.14 Mojave) to
      4.7.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Reminders</span>
    <p>
      Among other visual and functional overhauls, attachments can be added to
      reminders and Siri can intelligently estimate when to remind the user
      about an event.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Voice Memos</span>
    <p>
      The Voice Memos application, first ported from iOS to the Mac in macOS
      10.14 Mojave as version 2.0, was incremented to version 2.1.
    </p>
  </div>
  <span class="level-two">Removed or changed components</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      macOS Catalina exclusively supports 64-bit applications. 32-bit
      applications no longer run (including all software that utilizes the
      Carbon API as well as QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video
      codecs). Apple has also removed all 32-bit-only apps from the Mac App
      Store.
    </li>
    <li>
      Z shell (executable "zsh") is the default login shell and interactive
      shell in macOS Catalina, replacing Bash, the default shell since Mac OS X
      Panther in 2003. Bash continues to be available in macOS Catalina, along
      with other shells such as csh/tcsh and ksh.
    </li>
    <li>Dashboard has been removed in macOS Catalina.</li>
    <li>
      The ability to add Backgrounds in Photo Booth was removed in macOS
      Catalina.
    </li>
    <li>
      The command-line interface GNU Emacs application was removed in macOS
      Catalina.
    </li>
    <li>
      Built-in support for Perl, Python 2.7 and Ruby are included in macOS for
      compatibility with legacy software. Future versions of macOS will not
      include scripting language runtimes by default, possibly requiring users
      to install additional packages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Legacy AirDrop for connecting with Macs running Mac OS X Lion, Mountain
      Lion and Mavericks, or 2011 and older Macs has been removed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Support for legacy Safari extensions such as uBlock Origin, and WebSQL has
      been removed in Safari 13.
    </li>
    <li>Circular app icons now have outlines matching their main color.</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Security</span>
  <p>
    Ars Technica reported that macOS Catalina contained a critical privilege
    escalation vulnerability, which resulted in a backdoor being installed if
    users visited a Hong Kong pro-democracy website. The vulnerability was
    reported to Apple in August 2021 and patched in a Catalina update in
    September, but it had already been patched by Apple in macOS Big Sur 11.2,
    released 234 days earlier on February 1. Security experts have criticized
    Apple for not patching critical known vulnerabilities in older versions and
    for not being transparent about older versions only receiving some, but not
    all, security patches. The latest major release of Apple's operating systems
    (macOS, iOS, and others) receive all security updates.
