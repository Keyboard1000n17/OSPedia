    <p>
      Mac OS X was Apple's successor to the classic Mac OS. It was derived from
      NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD, and featured a new user interface called Aqua, as
      well as improved stability and security due to its new Unix foundations.
      It introduced the Quartz graphics rendering engine for
      hardware-accelerated animations. Many technologies were ported from the
      classic Mac OS, including Sherlock and the QuickTime framework. The core
      components of Mac OS X were open sourced as Darwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boxed releases of Mac OS X 10.0 also included a copy of Mac OS 9.1, which
      can be installed alongside Mac OS X 10.0, through the means of dual
      booting (which meant that reboots are required for switching between the
      two OSes). This was important for compatibility reasons; while many Mac OS
      9 applications could be run under Mac OS X in the Classic environment,
      some, such as applications that directly accessed hardware, could only run
      under Mac OS 9.
    </p>

    <p>
      Six months after its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was succeeded by Mac OS X
      10.1, code named Puma.

      <span class="level-two">New and updated features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The features of the release include the Dock which was a new way of
          organizing one's Mac OS X applications on a user interface, and a
          change from the classic method of application launching in previous
          Mac OS systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          It included Terminal, a terminal emulator that provides access to Mac
          OS X's Unix command-line interface; the classic Mac OS had previously
          had the distinction of being one of the few operating systems with no
          command line interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          The new Mail email client included the ability to configure the
          software to receive all of a user's email accounts in one list, the
          ability to file emails into folders, the ability to search for emails,
          and the ability to automatically append signatures to outgoing emails.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Address Book was a new application which had features including
          exporting and importing cards to and from vCard format, API to
          interface with other applications, change of address notifications,
          contact groups, auto-merge when importing vCards, customizable fields
          and categories, the automatic formatting of phone numbers.
        </li>
        <li>TextEdit replaced the SimpleText application with new features.</li>
        <li>
          PDF support was added; it allows the user to create PDFs from any
          application.
        </li>
        <li>The OS introduced the new Aqua UI.</li>
        <li>
          Several features of Mac OS 9 were ported to Mac OS X, including the
          Sherlock desktop and web search engine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          File-sharing client — The system can only use TCP/IP, not AppleTalk,
          to connect to servers sharing the Apple Filing Protocol. It cannot use
          SMB to connect to Windows or Samba servers.
        </li>
        <li>
          File-sharing server — As a server, the system can share files using
          only the Apple Filing Protocol (over TCP/IP), HTTP, SSH, and FTP.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optical media — Neither DVD playback nor burning CDs or DVDs is
          supported. However, audio CD burning was added in the Mac OS X 10.0.2
          update, roughly two months after initial release.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <summary class="level-one">Architecture</summary>
      <p>
        Mac OS X is built on Darwin, a Unix-like operating system derived from
        FreeBSD. Darwin includes a new kernel, XNU, derived from Mach and BSD,
        as a replacement for the Mac OS nanokernel used in classic Mac OS.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike Mac OS 9, Mac OS X has protected memory and preemptive
        multitasking. This means that if an application's memory becomes
        corrupted due to a bug, the application will crash without the entire
        system crashing and needing to be rebooted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mac OS X also had support for OpenGL, AppleScript, and the Carbon and
        Cocoa APIs.
