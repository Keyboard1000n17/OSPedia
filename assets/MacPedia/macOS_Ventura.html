  official graphics and default wallpaper resemble an abstract California poppy.
</p>
<p>
  macOS Ventura is the last version of macOS supporting Macs released in 2017,
  including the 21.5-inch 2017 iMac and the 12-inch MacBook, with the exception
  of the iMac Pro, which is supported by releases up to macOS Sequoia.
</p>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Ventura is the last release for Macs with Apple T1 Security chip.
    macOS Ventura officially supports Macs with Apple silicon and Intel's
    Skylake-based Xeon-W and 7th-generation Kaby Lake chips or later, and drops
    support for Macs released from 2015 to 2016, officially marking the end of
    support for the Retina MacBook Pro, 2015-2017 MacBook Air, 2014 Mac Mini,
    2015 iMac and cylindrical Mac Pro. The 2016 MacBook Pro is also dropped,
    however, the operating system can be installed and run using OpenCore
    because all required drivers for T1 system are present (drivers are removed
    in macOS Sonoma). The 21.5 inch 2017 iMac is the only supported standard
    configuration model to have no Retina display.
  </p>
  <p>Macs that support macOS Ventura are as follows.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (2017 or later)</li>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
    <li>MacBook (2017)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (2018 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (2017 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (2018 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (2019 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Studio (all models)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    AirPlay to Mac, always-on "Hey Siri", 4K HDR streaming, and Spatial Audio
    are not supported on all models. Offline dictation, Live Captions, Portrait
    Mode in FaceTime, and "Reference mode" (which allows users to use an iPad as
    a secondary reference monitor) only work on Apple silicon Macs.
  </p>
  <span class="level-two">Unofficial support on older models (discontinued hardware)</span>
  <p>
    By using patch tools, macOS Ventura can be unofficially installed on earlier
    models that are officially unsupported, such as a 2017 MacBook Air and a
    2015 MacBook Pro. Using these methods, it is possible to install macOS
    Ventura on models as early as a 2008 MacBook Pro or a 2007 iMac (after a
    Penryn CPU upgrade).

  <summary class="level-one">Features and Changes</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Ventura includes changes, many related to productivity, and adds two
    apps from iOS and iPadOS: Weather and Clock. Freeform was added in an update
    to all three operating systems.
  </p>
  <span class="level-two">New system features</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Stage Manager, which provides an alternative interface for multitasking,
      in addition to the previous Mission Control.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">New apps</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Weather: shows detailed weather forecasts. Clicking on the Weather widget
      now opens this app, not The Weather Channel's website.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clock: displays world time and manages alarms, stopwatches, and timers.
      Clicking on the Clock widget now opens this app, not the Date & Time
      section of System Preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
      Freeform: a whiteboard app that supports real-time collaboration. It was
      only added in version 13.1.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Changes</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Mail adds "send later" and "undo send" options and includes improvements
      to search, email organization, and formatting.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spotlight produces richer search results; with Live Text, it can return
      pictures that contain the queried text.
    </li>
    <li>
      Safari adds Shared Tab Groups and Passkeys, uses WebAuthn for
      password-less account management, gets a redesigned sidebar, and gains
      AVIF support.
    </li>
    <li>
      Messages now allows the user to edit and unsend recent iMessages, similar
      to iOS 16 and iPadOS 16.
    </li>
    <li>
      FaceTime gets Handoff, the ability to transfer a call between multiple
      Apple devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continuity Camera, a feature that allows a user's iPhone to wirelessly
      serve as a front-facing camera, with support for Desk View on some
      iPhones.
    </li>
    <li>
      System Preferences is renamed to System Settings and gets a brand new
      tabbed interface and re-organized panes based on the iOS/iPadOS Settings
      app. Because of this, the app-specific "Preferences..." menu bar item has
      been renamed "Settings..." for all apps.
    </li>
    <li>
      Photos app: iCloud Shared Photo Library allows multiple members of iCloud
      Family Sharing to add, edit, and delete photos in the same photo library.

      and receive new music notifications from those artists.
    </li>
    <li>
      Print dialogs have been redesigned. Many users report that Print Presets
      no longer save all essential printer features (paper type, duplexing,
      color mode, print quality, etc.) requiring settings to be manually
      selected with every print job.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ability to play ambient background sounds as an accessibility feature in
      System Settings.
    </li>

      in macOS Ventura VMs, support for graphics acceleration, folder sharing,
      and Rosetta 2 in Linux VMs.
    </li>
    <li>Metal 3, with support for spatial and temporal image upscaling.</li>

    </li>
    <li><b>iCloud</b></li>
    <ul>

        security vulnerabilities without having to install a full system update;
        according to Apple, these patches will not require a reboot.
      </li>
      <li>
        New Login Items section in System Settings (in the General pane), which
        shows all programs that start on boot (including all LaunchAgents and
        LaunchDaemons for both the user and the system). In previous versions of
        macOS, the Login Items list in the "Users & Groups" pane only showed
        programs that registered themselves to be displayed, and most malware
        would not have been listed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirmation before allowing data connections with USB-C accessories, to
        prevent malicious USB-C chargers from installing malware.

        Gatekeeper now checks the notarization of third-party apps every time
        they are launched.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lockdown Mode, which prevents USB devices from connecting when the Mac
        is asleep, blocks the installation of MDM profiles, limits the risk of
        malicious attachments in the Messages app, and removes just-in-time
        compilation for JavaScript in Safari.
      </li>
      <li>
        Built-in apps cannot be moved from the cryptographically verified Signed
        System Volume to another location where they could be tampered with.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The Preview app on Mac no longer supports PostScript (.ps) and
      Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) files. Printing of such files, to a printer
      natively supporting PostScript, remains possible by accessing the Printer
      Queue from System Settings and dragging the file into the queue window.
    </li>
    <li>Network Utility has been removed.</li>
    <li>
      The Network Locations feature was removed from the graphical user
      interface. It can still be accessed from the command line.
