<span id="heading">macOS Tahoe</span>
<p>
  macOS Tahoe (version 26) is the upcoming twenty-second major release of
  Apple's macOS operating system. The successor to macOS Sequoia (macOS 15), it
  was first announced at WWDC 2025 on June 9, 2025, with its first developer
  beta released the same day. In line with Apple's practice of naming macOS
  releases after landmarks in California, it is named after Tahoe, a lake
  straddling the border between California and Nevada.

  <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Tahoe supports all Macs with Apple silicon and some of those with
    Intel's 9th generation Coffee Lake Refresh, 10th generation Ice Lake and
    Comet Lake, and Cascade Lake-based Xeon-W processors, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>MacBook Air (M1, 2020) or later</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020, four Thunderbolt 3 ports) or later</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) or later</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) or later</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (M1, 2020) or later</li>
    <li>iMac (2020) or later</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (2019) or later</li>
    <li>All Mac Studio models</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    During its Platforms State of the Union event at WWDC 2025, Apple announced
    that macOS Tahoe will be the last version of macOS that supports Intel-based
    Macs. The only remaining Intel-based Macs supported by Tahoe are the Mac Pro
    (2019), the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), the MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2020,
    four Thunderbolt 3 ports) and the iMac (2020), thus ending support for
    Intel-based MacBook Air and Mac Mini models.

  <p>
    macOS Tahoe introduces several new features and improvements, mainly focused
    on the user interface:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The UI has been completely redesigned for the first time since macOS Big
      Sur to use Liquid Glass, making it more consistent with Apple's other
      platforms, which also receive it. The menu bar is now fully transparent by
      default. The cursor has been redesigned, now having a more rounded
      appearance. App icons have been unified with iOS and iPadOS, and can have
      dark and tinted variants as introduced in iOS with iOS 18/iPadOS 18, as
      well as a new clear variant.
    </li>
    <li>Some system sound effects are refined.</li>
    <li>
      Folder icons have been redesigned and can now have custom colors, emblems,
      and emojis, and can also abide to the accent color. They also now have
      animations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spotlight Search has been redesigned and gains quick actions, "quick-key"
      shortcuts, menubar search, and Apple Intelligence integration.
    </li>
    <li>
      Many iOS and iPadOS features have been brought over to the Mac, such as
      Live Activities and compact brightness/audio indicators.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Phone and Journal apps are now included as part of macOS. The Phone
      app uses Continuity to integrate with the iPhone.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Control Center has been redesigned, now functioning like and
      resembling the iOS version introduced in iOS 18/iPadOS 18.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Launchpad, introduced in OS X Lion and mostly unchanged afterwards,
      has been removed and replaced by the Applications feature which is similar
      to the App Library, used on iOS since iOS 14 and iPadOS since iPadOS 15.
      It is integrated into the Spotlight interface. iPhone apps also appear in
      the Applications list through Continuity from the user's iPhone, and will
      launch through iPhone Mirroring.
    </li>
    <li>
      Areas such as the Control Center, app opening and Spotlight Search now has
      increased animation.
    </li>
    <li>
      A Magnifier app, Vehicle Motion Cues, a system-wide Accessibility Reader,
      and support for Braille displays comes as part of expanded accessibility
      features.
    </li>
    <li>
      Some Lock Screen customisation features on iOS/iPadOS have been brought
      over to the Mac such as changing the color and font of the clock.
    </li>
    <li>Terminal gains support for 24-bit color and Powerline fonts.</li>
  </ul>
  <span class="level-two">Removed features</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Home only supports the redesigned architecture introduced with iOS 16 and
      macOS Ventura and ends support for the legacy architecture.
    </li>
    <li>Support for FireWire 400/800 has been removed.</li>
  </ul>
