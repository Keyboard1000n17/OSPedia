  Apple's macOS operating system, the successor to macOS Sonoma. It was
  announced at WWDC 2024 on June 10, 2024. In line with Apple's practice of
  naming macOS releases after landmarks in California, it is named after Sequoia
  National Park, located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Supported hardware</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Sequoia supports Macs with Apple silicon and those with Intel's
    Skylake-based Xeon W and 8th-generation Coffee Lake chips or later. A Mac
    with an M1 chip or later is required to use Apple Intelligence. macOS
    Sequoia supports every Mac that supports macOS Sonoma, with the exception of
    the 2018-2019 MacBook Air models with Amber Lake chips. Similar to Sonoma,
    the 2019 iMac is the only supported Intel Mac that lacks a T2 security chip.
    macOS Sequoia is the first version of macOS to drop support for a Mac with a
    T2 security chip.

  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <p>
    macOS Sequoia introduced several new features and improvements, mainly
    focused on productivity:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      iPhone Mirroring, a feature to mirror and interact with content from an
      iPhone running iOS 18 as a macOS window, has been introduced. It is
      supported on all Macs that run Sequoia except the 2019 iMac, which lacks a
      T2 chip. This function is not available in the European Union due to the
      lack of conformity to the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
    </li>
    <li>
      The Calculator app has been redesigned to be more similar to that of iOS
      and iPadOS, including rounded buttons, departing from the design that has
      been used since OS X Yosemite.
    </li>
    <li>
      Notes has been updated with the Math Notes feature, which can be used to
      calculate simple equations, evaluate expressions, and assign variables
      within the app.
    </li>
    <li>
      Passwords, a cross-platform password manager application, was introduced,
      which replaces Keychain.
    </li>
    <li>
      In System Settings, individual menus have been rearranged and slightly
      redesigned to quickly access frequently used menus.
    </li>
    <li>
      Safari has been revamped, including revamped reader mode (now called
      Reader), faster page load times, a new start page, a new option to hide a
      singular element on a webpage, and a new unified menu; these had
      previously been exclusive to compact mode on iOS/iPadOS.
    </li>
    <li>
      macOS Sequoia includes the second iteration of Game Porting Toolkit, a
      Windows API compatibility layer derived from Wine and Crossover, allowing
      developers to more easily port Windows games to macOS.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apple Intelligence is available on all Apple silicon Macs and includes
      artificial intelligence features such as a redesigned Siri, Writing Tools
      with which selected text can be proofread or have its tone changed, Smart
      Reply in Mail to quickly draft email responses, and a system-wide
      integration with ChatGPT.
    </li>
    <li>
      Window tiling is now automatically suggested by macOS when dragging a
      window to the edges of the display, similar to the Aero Snap feature
      included in Microsoft Windows.
    </li>
    <li>
      The Tips app is now an independent app from the rest of the operating
      system. The user interface (UI) has also been redesigned, and has replaced
      the previous Help system included in earlier versions of macOS. The app
      surfaces individual user guides for apps such as Freeform, Pages, Keynote,
      Notes, and Apple TV, and also surfaces user guides for any other devices a
      user may own, such as an iPhone, Apple Watch or Apple TV. As an
      independent app, it can also be pinned to the Dock.
