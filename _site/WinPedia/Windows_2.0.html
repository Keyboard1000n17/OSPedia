<p>
  Windows 2.0 is the second major release of the Microsoft Windows series of
  Operating Systems. It was released to manufaturing on December 9, 1987. It
  refined the User Interface of Windows 1.0 and introduced multiple improvments.
</p>

<div id="info">
  <img src="./Images/Icons/Windows_2.0-icon.webp" style="width: 30vh" />
  <p>Date released: December 9, 1987</p>
  <p>End of Support: December 31, 2001</p>
  <p>Last release: Windows 2.03 in December 9, 1987</p>
  <p>Succeeded by: Windows 3.0 (released 1990)</p>
  <p>Codename: None</p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>

<p>
  Windows 2.0 had 2 different variants: a base version for 8086 real mode
  (renamed to Windows/286 with the release of Windows 2.1) and Windows/386. The
  Operating System introduced new features such as overlapping windows, desktop
  icons, keyboard shortcuts, support for 16-color VGA graphics, and Microsoft
  Word and Excel. The OS was noted as an improvement over its predecessor.
</p>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Release Version/Editions</summary>
  <p>
    The operating environment came in two different variants with different
    names and CPU support. The basic edition supported the virtual 8086 mode of
    the 80386 microprocessor. Despite its configuration, the variant was fully
    operational on an 8088 or 8086 processor, although the high memory area
    would not be available on an 8086-class processor, however, expanded memory
    could still be used. IBM's PS/2 Model 25 had an option to ship with a "DOS
    4.00 and Windows kit" for educational markets, which shipped Windows with
    8086 hardware.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other variant, named Windows/386, was available as early as September
    1987, pre-dating the release of Windows 2.0 in December 1987. It was much
    more advanced than the other variant. It introduced a protected mode kernel,
    above which the GUI and applications run as a virtual 8086 mode task.â€Š The
    variant had fully preemptive multitasking, and allowed several MS-DOS
    programs to run in parallel in "virtual 8086" CPU mode, rather than always
    suspending background applications. With the exception of a few kilobytes of
    overhead, each DOS application could use any available low memory before
    Windows was started and users could run more applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    Neither version worked with DOS memory managers like CEMM or QEMM or with
    DOS extenders, which have their own extended memory management and run in
    protected mode as well. This was remedied in version 3.0, which is
    compatible with Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) in "standard mode"
    and with DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) in "386 enhanced" mode.
    Microsoft ended its support for Windows 2.0 on December 31, 2001.

  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <p>
    Unlike its predecessor, Windows 2.0 allows the user to overlap and resize
    application windows. It has also introduced desktop icons, keyboard
    shortcuts, and the terminology "minimize" and "maximize", as opposed to
    "iconize" and "zoom" which was used in Windows 1.0. Support for 16-color VGA
    graphics, EMS memory, and new capabilities of the i386 CPU in some versions
    were also added. Windows 2.0 is the last version of Windows that ran solely
    on floppy disks.
  </p>

  <p>
    The operating environment is shipped with fifteen programs, and it also
    introduced the GUI based programs Microsoft Word and Excel, to compete
    against the then-reigning competitors WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Software
    such as the Aldus Pagemaker and CorelDRAW were also developed for Windows
    2.0.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Windows API functions are largely handled by KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and
    GDI.EXE. These files along with device drivers, printer drivers being the
    exception, are combined by the Windows setup program into WIN200.BIN and
    WIN200.OVL. The system files WINOLDAP.MOD and WINOLDAP.GRB are used to run
    MS-DOS programs.
  </p>

  <p>
    IBM licensed Windows's GUI for OS/2 as Presentation Manager, and the two
    companies stated that it and Windows 2.0 would be almost identical.
  </p>

  <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
  <p>
    Windows 2.0 introduced dialogue boxes which provided a standard way for
    users to interact with applications. Drop-down menus were introduced in
    Windows 2.0 which made it easier to access commands from within programs.
    The standard Window Controls now used the terms "minimize" and "maximize",
    instead of "iconize" and "zoom". There was little change to MS-DOS
    Executive, if any. The icons in the Program Manager (seperate from MS-DOS
    Executive) were further refined and were now more graphical and easier to
    recognize.
