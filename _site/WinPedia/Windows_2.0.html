  Windows 2.0 is the second major release of the Microsoft Windows series of
  Operating Systems. It was released to manufaturing on December 9, 1987. It
  refined the User Interface of Windows 1.0 and introduced multiple improvments.

  <p>Date released: December 9, 1987</p>
  <p>End of Support: December 31, 2001</p>
  <p>Last release: Windows 2.03 in December 9, 1987</p>
  <p>Succeeded by: Windows 3.0 (released 1990)</p>
  <p>Codename: None</p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>

<p>
  Windows 2.0 had 2 different variants: a base version for 8086 real mode
  (renamed to Windows/286 with the release of Windows 2.1) and Windows/386. The
  Operating System introduced new features such as overlapping windows, desktop
  icons, keyboard shortcuts, support for 16-color VGA graphics, and Microsoft
  Word and Excel. The OS was noted as an improvement over its predecessor.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="editions">Release Version/Editions</h2>
<p>
  The operating environment came in two different variants with different names
  and CPU support. The basic edition supported the virtual 8086 mode of the
  80386 microprocessor. Despite its configuration, the variant was fully
  operational on an 8088 or 8086 processor, although the high memory area would
  not be available on an 8086-class processor, however, expanded memory could
  still be used. IBM's PS/2 Model 25 had an option to ship with a "DOS 4.00 and
  Windows kit" for educational markets, which shipped Windows with 8086
  hardware.
</p>

<p>
  The other variant, named Windows/386, was available as early as September
  1987, pre-dating the release of Windows 2.0 in December 1987. It was much more
  advanced than the other variant. It introduced a protected mode kernel, above
  which the GUI and applications run as a virtual 8086 mode task.  The variant
  had fully preemptive multitasking, and allowed several MS-DOS programs to run
  in parallel in "virtual 8086" CPU mode, rather than always suspending
  background applications. With the exception of a few kilobytes of overhead,
  each DOS application could use any available low memory before Windows was
  started and users could run more applications.
</p>

<p>
  Neither version worked with DOS memory managers like CEMM or QEMM or with DOS
  extenders, which have their own extended memory management and run in
  protected mode as well. This was remedied in version 3.0, which is compatible
  with Virtual Control Program Interface (VCPI) in "standard mode" and with DOS
  Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) in "386 enhanced" mode. Microsoft ended its
  support for Windows 2.0 on December 31, 2001.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="features">Features</h2>
<p>
  Unlike its predecessor, Windows 2.0 allows the user to overlap and resize
  application windows. It has also introduced desktop icons, keyboard shortcuts,
  and the terminology "minimize" and "maximize", as opposed to "iconize" and
  "zoom" which was used in Windows 1.0. Support for 16-color VGA graphics, EMS
  memory, and new capabilities of the i386 CPU in some versions were also added.
  Windows 2.0 is the last version of Windows that ran solely on floppy disks.
</p>

<p>
  The operating environment is shipped with fifteen programs, and it also
  introduced the GUI based programs Microsoft Word and Excel, to compete against
  the then-reigning competitors WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Software such as
  the Aldus Pagemaker and CorelDRAW were also developed for Windows 2.0.
</p>

<p>
  The Windows API functions are largely handled by KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and
  GDI.EXE. These files along with device drivers, printer drivers being the
  exception, are combined by the Windows setup program into WIN200.BIN and
  WIN200.OVL. The system files WINOLDAP.MOD and WINOLDAP.GRB are used to run
  MS-DOS programs.
</p>

<p>
  IBM licensed Windows's GUI for OS/2 as Presentation Manager, and the two
  companies stated that it and Windows 2.0 would be almost identical.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Windows 2.0 introduced dialogue boxes which provided a standard way for users
  to interact with applications. Drop-down menus were introduced in Windows 2.0
  which made it easier to access commands from within programs. The standard
  Window Controls now used the terms "minimize" and "maximize", instead of
  "iconize" and "zoom". There was little change to MS-DOS Executive, if any. The
  icons in the Program Manager (seperate from MS-DOS Executive) were further
  refined and were now more graphical and easier to recognize.
