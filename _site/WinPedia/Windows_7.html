    Windows 7 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
    Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became
    generally available on October 22, 2009. It is the successor to Windows
    Vista, released nearly three years earlier. Windows 7's server counterpart,
    Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same time. It was succeeded by
    Windows 8 in October 2012.

  <p>
    Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, over ten years after the release
    of Windows 7, after which the operating system ceased receiving further
    updates. A paid support program was available for enterprises, providing
    security updates for Windows 7 for up to three years after the official end
    of life. Windows 7 was intended to be an incremental upgrade to Microsoft
    Windows, addressing Windows Vista's poor critical reception while
    maintaining hardware and software compatibility. Windows 7 continued
    improvements on the Windows Aero user interface with the addition of a
    redesigned taskbar that allows pinned applications, and new window
    management features. Other new features were added to the operating system
    which included libraries, the new file-sharing system HomeGroup, and support
    for multitouch input. A new "Action Center" was added to provide an overview
    of system security and maintenance information, and the User Account Control
    system was slightly modified to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also
    shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including
    Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike Windows Vista, Windows 7 received lots of praise, with critics
    considering the operating system to be a major improvement over its
    predecessor because of its improved performance, its more intuitive
    interface, fewer User Account Control popups, and other improvements made
    across the operating system. Windows 7 was a major success for Microsoft;
    even before its official release, pre-order sales for the operating system
    on the online retailer Amazon.com had surpassed previous records. In just
    six months, over 100 million copies had been sold worldwide, increasing to
    over 630 million licenses by July 2012. By January 2018, Windows 10
    surpassed Windows 7 as the most popular version of Windows worldwide.
    Windows 11 overtook Windows 7 as the second most popular Windows version on
    all continents in August 2022. The legacy and impact of Windows 7 is still
    seen today. As of 2024, just 3% of traditional PCs running Windows are
    running Windows 7, although it remains relatively popular in parts of the
    world, such as China (where it is tied with Windows 11), and is still second
    most popular in some countries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Windows 7 is the final version of Windows that supports processors without
    SSE2 or NX (although an update released in 2018 dropped support for non-SSE2
    processors). Its successor, Windows 8, requires a processor with SSE2 and NX
    (for any then-supported architecture).

    <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
    <p>
      Originally, a version of Windows codenamed "Blackcomb" was planned as the
      successor to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 in 2000. Major features
      were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on searching and
      querying data and an advanced storage system named WinFS to enable such
      scenarios. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed "Longhorn," was
      announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb. By the middle
      of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally
      intended for Blackcomb. After three major malware outbreaks—the Blaster,
      Nachi, and Sobig worms—exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within
      a short time period in August 2003, Microsoft changed its development
      priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold
      while developing new service packs for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
      Development of Longhorn (Windows Vista) was also restarted, and thus
      delayed, in August 2004. A number of features were cut from Longhorn.
      Blackcomb was renamed Vienna in early 2006, and was later canceled in 2007
      due to the scope of the project.
    </p>

    <p>
      When released, Windows Vista was criticized for its long development time,
      performance issues, spotty compatibility with existing hardware and
      software at launch, changes affecting the compatibility of certain PC
      games, and unclear assurances by Microsoft that certain computers shipping
      with XP before launch would be "Vista Capable" (which led to a
      class-action lawsuit), among other critiques. As such, the adoption of
      Vista in comparison to XP remained somewhat low. In July 2007, following
      the shelving of the Vienna project and six months following the public
      release of Vista, it was reported that the next version of Windows would
      then be codenamed Windows 7, with plans for a final release within three
      years. Bill Gates, in an interview with Newsweek, suggested that Windows 7
      would be more "user-centric". Gates later said that Windows 7 would also
      focus on performance improvements. Steven Sinofsky later expanded on this
      point, explaining in the Engineering Windows 7 blog that the company was
      using a variety of new tracing tools to measure the performance of many
      areas of the operating system on an ongoing basis, to help locate
      inefficient code paths and to help prevent performance regressions. Senior
      Vice President Bill Veghte stated that Windows Vista users migrating to
      Windows 7 would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they
      encountered migrating from Windows XP. An estimated 1,000 developers
      worked on Windows 7. These were broadly divided into "core operating
      system" and "Windows client experience", in turn organized into 25 teams
      of around 40 developers on average.
    </p>

    <p>
      In October 2008, it was announced that Windows 7 would also be the
      official name of the operating system. There had been some confusion over
      naming the product Windows 7, while versioning it as 6.1 to indicate its
      similar build to Windows Vista and increase compatibility with
      applications that only check major version numbers, similar to Windows
      2000 and Windows XP both having 5.x version numbers. The first external
      release to select Microsoft partners came in January 2008 with Milestone
      1, build 6519. Speaking about Windows 7 on October 16, 2008, Microsoft CEO
      Steve Ballmer confirmed compatibility between Windows Vista and Windows 7,
      indicating that Windows 7 would be a refined version of Windows Vista.
    </p>

    <p>
      At PDC 2008, Microsoft demonstrated Windows 7 with its reworked taskbar.
      On December 27, 2008, the Windows 7 Beta was leaked onto the Internet via
      BitTorrent. According to a performance test by ZDNet, Windows 7 Beta beat
      both Windows XP and Windows Vista in several key areas, including boot and
      shutdown time and working with files, such as loading documents. Other
      areas did not beat XP, including PC Pro benchmarks for typical office
      activities and video editing, which remain identical to Vista and slower
      than XP. On January 7, 2009, the x64 version of the Windows 7 Beta (build
      7000) was leaked onto the web, with some torrents being infected with a
      trojan. At CES 2009, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer announced the Windows 7
      Beta, build 7000, had been made available for download to MSDN and TechNet
      subscribers in the format of an ISO image. The stock wallpaper of the beta
      version contained a digital image of the Betta fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      The release candidate, build 7100, became available for MSDN and TechNet
      subscribers, and Connect Program participants on April 30, 2009. On May 5,
      2009, it became available to the general public, although it had also been
      leaked onto the Internet via BitTorrent. The release candidate was
      available in five languages and expired on June 1, 2010, with shutdowns
      every two hours starting March 1, 2010. Microsoft stated that Windows 7
      would be released to the general public on October 22, 2009, less than
      three years after the launch of its predecessor. Microsoft released
      Windows 7 to MSDN and Technet subscribers on August 6, 2009. Microsoft
      announced that Windows 7, along with Windows Server 2008 R2, was released
      to manufacturing in the United States and Canada on July 22, 2009. Windows
      7 build 7600.16385.090713-1255, which was compiled on July 13, 2009, was
      declared the final RTM build after passing all Microsoft's tests
      internally.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <p>
      Among Windows 7's new features are advances in touch and handwriting
      recognition, support for virtual hard disks, improved performance on
      multi-core processors, improved boot performance, DirectAccess, and kernel
      improvements. Windows 7 adds support for systems using multiple
      heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors (Heterogeneous
      Multi-adapter), a new version of Windows Media Center, a Gadget for
      Windows Media Center, improved media features, XPS Essentials Pack, and
      Windows PowerShell being included, and a redesigned Calculator with
      multiline capabilities including Programmer and Statistics modes along
      with unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and several others.
      Many new items have been added to the Control Panel, including ClearType
      Text Tuner, Display Color Calibration Wizard, Gadgets, Recovery,
      Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and Other Sensors, Credential
      Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons, and Display. Windows Security
      Center has been renamed to Action Center (Windows Health Center and
      Windows Solution Center in earlier builds), which encompasses both
      security and maintenance of the computer. ReadyBoost on 32-bit editions
      now supports up to 256 gigabytes of extra allocation. Windows 7 also
      supports images in RAW image format through the addition of Windows
      Imaging Component-enabled image decoders, which enables raw image
      thumbnails, previewing and metadata display in Windows Explorer, plus
      full-size viewing and slideshows in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media
      Center. Windows 7 also has a native TFTP client with the ability to
      transfer files to or from a TFTP server.
    </p>

    <p>
      The taskbar has seen the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick
      Launch toolbar has been replaced with the ability to pin applications to
      the taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task
      buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to
      common tasks, and files frequently used with specific applications. The
      revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far
      right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the
      Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible
      windows transparent for a quick look at the desktop. In touch-enabled
      displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly
      (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger.
      Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time
      restores them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Window management in Windows 7 has several new features: Aero Snap
      maximizes a window when it is dragged to the top, left, or right of the
      screen. Dragging windows to the left or right edges of the screen allows
      users to snap software windows to either side of the screen, such that the
      windows take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were
      snapped or maximized using Snap, the system restores their previous state.
      Snap functions can also be triggered with keyboard shortcuts. Aero Shake
      hides all inactive windows when the active window's title bar is dragged
      back and forth rapidly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows 7 includes 13 additional sound schemes, titled Afternoon,
      Calligraphy, Characters, Cityscape, Delta, Festival, Garden, Heritage,
      Landscape, Quirky, Raga, Savanna, and Sonata. Internet Spades, Internet
      Backgammon and Internet Checkers, which were removed in Windows Vista,
      were restored in Windows 7. Users are able to disable or customize many
      more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista. New additions
      to this list of components include Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media
      Player 12, Windows Media Center, Windows Search, and Windows Gadget
      Platform. A new version of Microsoft Virtual PC, newly renamed as Windows
      Virtual PC was made available for Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, and
      Ultimate editions. It allows multiple Windows environments, including
      Windows XP Mode, to run on the same machine. Windows XP Mode runs Windows
      XP in a virtual machine, and displays applications within separate windows
      on the Windows 7 desktop. Furthermore, Windows 7 supports the mounting of
      a virtual hard disk (VHD) as a normal data storage, and the bootloader
      delivered with Windows 7 can boot the Windows system from a VHD; however,
      this ability is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions.
      The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) of Windows 7 is also enhanced to support
      real-time multimedia application including video playback and 3D games,
      thus allowing use of DirectX 10 in remote desktop environments. The three
      application limit, previously present in the Windows Vista and Windows XP
      Starter Editions, has been removed from Windows 7. All editions include
      some new and improved features, such as Windows Search, Security features,
      and some features new to Windows 7, that originated within Vista. Optional
      BitLocker Drive Encryption is included with Windows 7 Ultimate and
      Enterprise. Windows Defender is included; Microsoft Security Essentials
      antivirus software is a free download. All editions include Shadow Copy,
      which—every day or so—System Restore uses (Shadow Copy) to take an
      automatic "previous version" snapshot of user files that have changed.
      Backup and restore have also been improved, and the Windows Recovery
      Environment—installed by default—replaces the optional Recovery Console of
      Windows XP.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new system known as "Libraries" was added for file management; users can
      aggregate files from multiple folders into a "Library." By default,
      libraries for categories such as Documents, Pictures, Music, and Video are
      created, consisting of the user's personal folder and the Public folder
      for each. The system is also used as part of a new home networking system
      known as HomeGroup; devices are added to the network with a password, and
      files and folders can be shared with all other devices in the HomeGroup,
      or with specific users. The default libraries, along with printers, are
      shared by default, but the personal folder is set to read-only access by
      other users, and the Public folder can be accessed by anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows 7 includes improved globalization support through a new Extended
      Linguistic Services API to provide multilingual support (particularly in
      Ultimate and Enterprise editions). Microsoft also implemented better
      support for solid-state drives, including the new TRIM command, and
      Windows 7 is able to identify a solid-state drive uniquely. Native support
      for USB 3.0 is not included because of delays in the finalization of the
      standard. At WinHEC 2008 Microsoft announced that color depths of 30-bit
      and 48-bit would be supported in Windows 7 along with the wide color gamut
      scRGB (which for HDMI 1.3 can be converted and output as xvYCC). The video
      modes supported in Windows 7 are 16-bit sRGB, 24-bit sRGB, 30-bit sRGB,
      30-bit with extended color gamut sRGB, and 48-bit scRGB.
    </p>

    <p>
      For developers, Windows 7 includes a new networking API with support for
      building SOAP-based web services in native code (as opposed to .NET-based
      WCF web services), new features to simplify development of installation
      packages and shorten application install times. Windows 7, by default,
      generates fewer User Account Control (UAC) prompts because it allows
      digitally signed Windows components to gain elevated privileges without a
      prompt. Additionally, users can now adjust the level at which UAC operates
      using a sliding scale.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certain capabilities and programs that were a part of Windows Vista are no
      longer present or have been changed, resulting in the removal of certain
      functionalities; these include the classic Start Menu user interface, some
      taskbar features, Windows Explorer features, Windows Media Player
      features, Windows Ultimate Extras, Search button, and InkBall. Four
      applications bundled with Windows Vista—Windows Photo Gallery, Windows
      Movie Maker, Windows Calendar and Windows Mail—are not included with
      Windows 7 and were replaced by Windows Live-branded versions as part of
      the Windows Live Essentials suite.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 7 is available in six different editions, of which the Home
      Premium, Professional, and Ultimate were available at retail in most
      countries, and as pre-loaded software on most new computers. Home Premium
      and Professional were aimed at home users and small businesses
      respectively, while Ultimate was aimed at enthusiasts. Each edition of
      Windows 7 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition
      below it, and adds additional features oriented towards their market
      segments; for example, Professional adds additional networking and
      security features such as Encrypting File System and the ability to join a
      domain. Ultimate contained a superset of the features from Home Premium
      and Professional, along with other advanced features oriented towards
      power users, such as BitLocker drive encryption; unlike Windows Vista,
      there were no "Ultimate Extras" add-ons created for Windows 7 Ultimate.
      Retail copies were available in "upgrade" and higher-cost "full" version
      licenses; "upgrade" licenses require an existing version of Windows to
      install, while "full" licenses can be installed on computers with no
      existing operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remaining three editions were not available at retail, of which two
      were available exclusively through OEM channels as pre-loaded software.
      The Starter edition is a stripped-down version of Windows 7 meant for
      low-cost devices such as netbooks. In comparison to Home Premium, Starter
      has reduced multimedia functionality, does not allow users to change their
      desktop wallpaper or theme, disables the "Aero Glass" theme, does not have
      support for multiple monitors, and can only address 2GB of RAM. Home Basic
      was sold only in emerging markets, and was positioned in between Home
      Premium and Starter. The highest edition, Enterprise, is functionally
      similar to Ultimate, but is only sold through volume licensing via
      Microsoft's Software Assurance program.
    </p>

    <p>
      All editions aside from Starter support both IA-32 and x86-64
      architectures, Starter only supports 32-bit systems. Retail copies of
      Windows 7 are distributed on two DVDs: one for the IA-32 version and the
      other for x86-64. OEM copies include one DVD, depending on the processor
      architecture licensed. The installation media for consumer versions of
      Windows 7 are identical, the product key and corresponding license
      determines the edition that is installed. The Windows Anytime Upgrade
      service can be used to purchase an upgrade that unlocks the functionality
      of a higher edition, such as going from Starter to Home Premium, and Home
      Premium to Ultimate. Most copies of Windows 7 only contained one license;
      in certain markets, a "Family Pack" version of Windows 7 Home Premium was
      also released for a limited time, which allowed upgrades on up to three
      computers. In certain regions, copies of Windows 7 were only sold in, and
      could only be activated in a designated region.

    <!-- WRITTEN FROM KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WINDOWS 7, NOT COPIED FROM OUTSIDE-->
    <p>
      Windows 7 kept the Windows Aero theme, albeit with a few changes. Some of
      the lower editions like Starter and Home Basic did not support Windows
      Aero effects, as they were meant for low-end PCs which would be likely
      incapable of handling complex visual effects. The higher editions
      supported Windows Aero effects, but could be disabled if one prefers so.
      The taskbar was different from the the one in Windows Vista; it was
      redesigned so that one could pin applications to the taskbar for quick
      access, eliminating the need for the Quick Launch toolbar and therefore
      leading to its removal.
