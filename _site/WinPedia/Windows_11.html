  <p>
    Windows 11 is the latest major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating
    system, released on October 5, 2021. It succeeded Windows 10 (2015), and is
    available for free for any Windows 10 devices that meet the new Windows 11
    system requirements. Windows 11 features major changes to the Windows shell
    influenced by the canceled Windows 10X, including a redesigned Start menu,
    the replacement of its "live tiles" with a separate "Widgets" panel on the
    taskbar, the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized
    and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies
    inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage
    on compatible hardware. Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced by the
    Chromium-based Microsoft Edge as the default web browser, like its
    predecessor, Windows 10, and Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows
    shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software
    that can be distributed via the Microsoft Store and to support Android apps
    on Windows 11.

    <p>Date released: October 5, 2021</p>
    <p>End of Support: October 14, 2031</p>
    <p>Preceded by: Windows 10 (2015)</p>
    <p>Succeeded by: Latest major release of Microsoft Windows</p>
    <p>Codename: Sun Valley</p>
    <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Citing security considerations, the system requirements for Windows 11 were
    increased over Windows 10; Microsoft only officially supports the operating
    system on devices using an eighth-generation Intel Core CPU or newer (with
    some minor exceptions), a second-generation AMD Ryzen CPU or newer, or a
    Qualcomm Snapdragon 850 ARM system-on-chip or newer, with UEFI and Trusted
    Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 supported and enabled. However, there are some
    exceptions to these requirements. While the OS can be installed on devices
    with unsupported configurations, Microsoft does not guarantee the
    availability of updates. Furthermore, Windows 11 completely removes support
    for 32-bit CPUs, including both 32-bit x86 and 32-bit ARM processors,
    ensuring compatibility only with 64-bit x86-64 and ARM64 processors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Windows 11 received a mixed reception at launch. Pre-release coverage of the
    operating system focused on its stricter hardware requirements, with
    discussions over whether they were legitimately intended to improve the
    security of Windows, or as a ploy to upsell customers to newer devices, and
    over the e-waste associated with the changes. Upon release, it was praised
    for its improved visual design, window management, and stronger focus on
    security, but was criticized for various modifications to aspects of its
    user interface that were seen as worse than its predecessor; some were seen
    as an attempt to dissuade users from switching to competing applications.
    Additionally, some users have pointed out disadvantages such as the removal
    of features like the ability to move the taskbar and increased system
    requirements that may exclude older devices. As of November 2024, Windows
    11, accounting for 35% of Windows installations worldwide, is the second
    most popular Windows version in use, with its predecessor Windows 10 still
    being the most used version in virtually all countries (with Guyana being an
    exception, where Windows 11 is the most used), with it globally at over 2
    times the market share. Windows 11 has an estimated 23% share of all PCs
    (the rest being other Windows editions and other operating systems such as
    macOS and Linux), and an estimated 8.6% share of all devices (including
    mobile, tablet and console) are running Windows 11.

    <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
    <p>
      In October 2019, Microsoft announced "Windows 10X", a future edition of
      Windows 10 designed exclusively for dual-touchscreen devices such as the
      then-upcoming Surface Neo. In May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic,
      Panos Panay, Microsoft's chief product officer for Microsoft Windows and
      Microsoft Office, stated that "as we continue to put customers' needs at
      the forefront, we need to focus on meeting customers where they are now",
      and announced that Windows 10X would only launch on single-screen devices
      at first, and that Microsoft would "continue to look for the right moment,
      in conjunction with our OEM partners, to bring dual-screen devices to
      market". In October 2020, reports emerged that Microsoft was working on a
      user interface refresh for Windows 10 codenamed "Sun Valley", scheduled to
      be included in a late-2021 feature update codenamed "Cobalt". Internal
      documentation stated that the aim for "Sun Valley" was to "reinvigorate"
      the Windows user interface and make it more "fluid", with a more
      consistent application of WinUI, while reports suggested Microsoft planned
      to adapt UI elements seen in Windows 10X. In January 2021, it was reported
      that a job listing referring to a "sweeping visual rejuvenation of
      Windows" had been posted by Microsoft. By December 2020, Microsoft had
      begun to implement and announce some of these visual changes and other new
      features on Windows 10 Insider Preview builds, such as new system icons,
      improvements to Task View to allow changing the wallpaper on each virtual
      desktop, x86-64 emulation on ARM, and adding the Auto HDR feature from
      Xbox Series X. On May 18, 2021, Head of Windows Servicing and Delivery
      John Cable stated that Windows 10X had been canceled and that Microsoft
      would be "accelerating the integration of key foundational 10X technology
      into other parts of Windows and products at the company".

    <p>
      On June 24, 2021, Windows 11 was officially announced at a virtual event
      hosted by Chief Product Officer Panos Panay. According to Nadella, Windows
      11 is "a re-imagining of the operating system". Further details for
      developers such as updates to the Microsoft Store, the new Windows App SDK
      (code-named "Project Reunion"), new Fluent Design guidelines, and more
      were discussed during another developer-focused event on the same day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows 11, the first major Windows release since 2015, builds upon its
      predecessor by revamping the user interface to follow Microsoft's new
      Fluent Design guidelines. The redesign, which focuses on ease of use and
      flexibility, comes alongside new productivity and social features and
      updates to security and accessibility, addressing some of the deficiencies
      of Windows 10. The Microsoft Store, which serves as a unified storefront
      for apps and other content, is also redesigned in Windows 11. The
      collaboration platform Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows 11
      user interface, and is accessible via the taskbar. Microsoft claims
      performance improvements such as smaller update sizes, faster web browsing
      in "any browser", faster wake time from sleep mode, and faster Windows
      Hello authentication. Windows 11 ships with the Chromium-based Microsoft
      Edge web browser (for compatibility with Google Chrome web browser), and
      does not include or support Internet Explorer. Its rendering engine MSHTML
      (Trident) is still included with the operating system for backwards
      compatibility reasons, and Edge can be configured with Group Policy to
      render whitelisted websites in "IE Mode" (which still uses IE's rendering
      engine MSHTML, instead of Blink layout engine). Windows 11 is the first
      version of Windows since the original retail release of Windows 95 to not
      ship with Internet Explorer. The updated Xbox app, along with the Auto HDR
      and DirectStorage technologies introduced by the Xbox Series X and Series
      S, will be integrated into Windows 11; the latter requiring a graphics
      card supporting DirectX 12 and an NVMe solid-state drive.

    </p>

    <p>
      The Microsoft Store, which serves as a unified storefront for apps and
      other content, is also redesigned in Windows 11. Microsoft now allows
      developers to distribute Win32, progressive web applications, and other
      packaging technologies in the Microsoft Store, alongside Universal Windows
      Platform apps. Microsoft also announced plans to allow third-party
      application stores (such as Epic Games Store) to distribute their clients
      on Microsoft Store. Windows 11 supports x86-64 software emulation on
      ARM-based platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The collaboration platform Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows
      11 user interface, and is accessible via the taskbar. Skype will no longer
      be bundled with the OS by default. In early 2023, the Phone Link app
      gained limited support for iMessage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Microsoft claims performance improvements such as smaller update sizes,
      faster web browsing in "any browser", faster wake time from sleep mode,
      and faster Windows Hello authentication.

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Windows Subsystem for Android</summary>
      <p>
        On October 21, 2021, Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) became
        available to Beta channel builds of Windows 11 for users in the United
        States, which allows users to install and run Android apps on their
        devices. Users can install Android apps through any source using the APK
        file format. An Amazon Appstore client for Microsoft Store is also
        available. The Windows Subsystem for Android and Amazon Appstore became
        available to Release channel users in the United States on February 15,
        2022, in Windows 11 Release build 22000.527. On March 5, 2024, Microsoft
        announced deprecation of WSA with support ending on March 5, 2025.
      </p>

      <p>
        WSA is based on the Intel Bridge runtime compiler; Intel stated that the
        technology is not dependent on its CPUs, and will also be supported on
        x86-64 and ARM CPUs from other vendors.

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Setup</summary>
      <p>
        Home and Pro (since version 22H2) edition installation requires internet
        connection and Microsoft account login (only if for personal use on Pro)
        is mandatory unless manually bypassed to create a local user. However,
        Microsoft has since blocked one of the last remaining easy bypass
        methods that allowed local account creation during initial setup,
        complicating the bypass process further. All other editions are excluded
        from this requirement.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">System security</summary>
      <p>
        As part of the minimum system requirements, Windows 11 only runs on
        devices with a Trusted Platform Module 2.0 security coprocessor, albeit
        with some exceptions, see System requirements for details. According to
        Microsoft, the TPM 2.0 coprocessor is a "critical building block" for
        protection against firmware and hardware attacks. In addition, Microsoft
        now requires devices with Windows 11 to include virtualization-based
        security (VBS), hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI), and Secure
        Boot built-in and enabled by default. The operating system also features
        hardware-enforced stack protection for supported Intel and AMD
        processors for protection against zero-day exploits.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like its predecessor, Windows 11 also supports multi-factor
        authentication and biometric authentication through Windows Hello.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Artificial intelligence</summary>
      <p>
        In subsequent updates, Microsoft added several features based on
        artificial intelligence (AI), like live captions, background noise
        removal in videoconferencing, webcam auto-framing that follows the
        user's movements, and AI-powered Bing Chat in the taskbar's search
        field. Following the integration of GPT-4 in Microsoft's other products,
        the company announced that by summer 2023, the newly released Microsoft
        Copilot would add GPT-4 integration to the Windows taskbar.
      </p>

      <p>
        On May 20, 2024, Microsoft officially announced Recall, a feature that
        uses a hardware AI accelerator to locally store snapshots of the user's
        activity (including content transcribed using live captions), and which
        allows users to search through them. This feature is exclusive to
        devices certified under the "Copilot+ PC" branding. Following pushback
        from the cyber security community, Microsoft delayed the feature in June
        2024. A preview version will be added to the Microsoft Insider program
        at later date in order to test added security measures.
      </p>
    </details>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 11 is available in two main editions; the Home edition, which is
      intended for consumer users, and the Pro edition, which contains
      additional networking and security features (such as BitLocker), as well
      as the ability to join a domain. Windows 11 Home may be restricted by
      default to verified software obtained from Microsoft Store ("S Mode").
      Windows 11 Home requires an Internet connection and a Microsoft account in
      order to complete first-time setup. This restriction is also applied to
      Windows 11 Pro since version 22H2 as it was announced in February 2022,
      although a Microsoft account isn't required if it's not for personal use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows 11 SE was announced on November 9, 2021, as an edition exclusively
      for low-end devices sold in the education market; it is intended as a
      successor to Windows 10 S, and also competes primarily with ChromeOS. It
      is designed to be managed via Microsoft Intune, and has changed based on
      feedback from educators to simplify the user interface and reduce
      "distractions", such as Snap Layouts not containing layouts for more than
      two applications at once, all applications opening maximized by default,
      and Widgets being removed. It is bundled with applications such as
      Microsoft Office for Microsoft 365, Minecraft Education Edition, and
      Flipgrid, while OneDrive is used to save files by default. Windows 11 SE
      does not include Microsoft Store; third-party software is provisioned or
      installed by administrators. To target organizations migrating from Google
      Chrome, Microsoft Edge is configured by default to enable the installation
      of extensions from the Chrome Web Store. Other editions include Pro
      Education, Pro for Workstations, Education, Enterprise, Enterprise
      multi-session, IoT Enterprise, Enterprise LTSC, IoT Enterprise LTSC, Home
      Single Language, and Team; along with regional variations. These editions
      remain fundamentally the same as their Windows 10 edition counterparts.
      Two new editions called IoT Enterprise Subscription and IoT Enterprise
      Subscription LTSC have been introduced in version 24H2.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
    <p>
      A redesigned user interface is present frequently throughout the operating
      system, building upon the Fluent Design System; translucency, shadows, a
      new color palette, and a rounded geometry are prevalent throughout the UI.
      A prevalent aspect of the design is an appearance known as "Mica",
      described as an "opaque, dynamic material that incorporates theme and
      desktop wallpaper to paint the background of long-lived windows such as
      apps and settings". Much of the interface and start menu takes heavy
      inspiration from the now-canceled Windows 10X. The Segoe UI font used
      since Windows Vista has been updated to a variable version, improving its
      ability to scale between different display resolutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The taskbar's buttons are center-aligned by default, and it is permanently
      pinned to the bottom edge of the screen; it cannot be moved to the top,
      left, or right edges of the screen as in previous versions of Windows
      without manual changes to the registry. The notifications sidebar is now
      accessed by clicking the date and time, with other Quick Actions toggles,
      as well as volume, brightness, and media playback controls, moved to a new
      settings pop-up displayed by clicking on the system tray. The "Widgets"
      button on the taskbar displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news
      aggregator with personalized stories and content (expanding upon the "news
      and interests" panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10). Microsoft
      Teams is similarly integrated with the taskbar, with a pop-up showing a
      list of recent conversations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Start menu has been significantly redesigned, replacing the "live
      tiles" used by Windows 8.x and 10 with a grid of "pinned" applications,
      and a list of recent applications and documents. File Explorer was updated
      to replace its ribbon toolbar with a more traditional toolbar, while its
      context menus have been redesigned to move some tasks (such as copy and
      paste) to a toolbar along the top of the menu, and hide other operations
      under an overflow menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      Task View, a feature introduced in Windows 10, features a refreshed
      design, and supports giving separate wallpapers to each virtual desktop.
      The window snapping functionality has been enhanced with two additional
      features; hovering over a window's maximize button displays pre-determined
      "Snap Layouts" for tiling multiple windows onto a display, and tiled
      arrangement of windows can be minimized and restored from the taskbar as a
      "snap group". When a display is disconnected in a multi-monitor
      configuration, the windows that were previously on that display will be
      minimized rather than automatically moved to the main display. If the same
      display is reconnected, the windows are restored to their prior location.
