<h1 id="heading">Windows</h1>
<p>
  Windows is a graphical operating system developed and marketed by Microsoft.
  It is the most popular operating system, preinstalled on most manufactured
  desktop PCs and laptops and having around 70% market share.
</p>
<p>
  There are a few families of the OS, which cater to specific sectors of the
  market such as Windows for personal computers, Windows Server for servers and
  Windows IoT for embedded systems. Windows itself is grouped into families that
  cater to different users: Home for home users, Professional for advanced users
  and Enterprise for business and corporations.

  </h2>
  <p>
    Windows 1.0 was the first major version of the Microsoft Windows series of
    Operating Systems, released on November 20, 1985 for US and to European
    nations in May of 1986. It marked a significant step in the evolution of
    Personal Computers (PCs). It was not a full-fledged operating system but
    rather a graphical shell that ran on top of MS-DOS (mentioned in Other
    Notable Versions of Windows, check it out after reading this). This approach
    introduced a user-friendly interface with icons and windows, compared to the
    command-line DOS-interface, which made computers more accessible to a wider
    audience.

  </h2>
  <p>
    Windows 2.0 is the second major release of the Microsoft Windows series of
    Operating Systems. It was released to manufaturing on December 9, 1987. It
    refined the user interface of Windows 1.0 and introduced multiple
    improvments. It came in two different variants with varying underlying
    hardware features. It also introduced things like dialogue boxes, drop-down
    menus and overlapping windows.

  </h2>
  <p>
    Windows 3.0 is the third major release of Microsoft Windows, launched on May
    22, 1990. It introduces a new graphical user interface (GUI) that represents
    applications as clickable icons, instead of the list of file names in its
    predecessors. Later updates expand capabilities, such as multimedia support
    for sound recording and playback, and support for CD-ROMs. It was the first
    version of Windows to perform well both critically and commercially, and was
    seen as a major improvement over its previous offering of Windows 2.0. Its
    GUI was considered a challenger to those used and popularized by the Apple
    Macintosh and Commodore Amiga. Other praised features include improved
    multitasking, customizability, and especially the utilitarian memory
    management that troubled the users of Windows 3.0's predecessors. The
    software was a major success, achieving 10 million sales.

  <p>
    Windows 3.1 is a major release of Microsoft Windows. It was released to
    manufacturing on April 6, 1992, as a successor to Windows 3.0. Like its
    predecessors, the Windows 3.1 series run as a shell on top of MS-DOS. It was
    the last Windows 16-bit operating environment as all future versions of
    Windows had moved to 32-bit. The series is considered to be an improvement
    on its predecessors. It was praised for its reinvigoration of the user
    interface and technical design. Windows 3.1 sold over three million copies
    during the first three months of its release, although its counterpart
    Windows for Workgroups was noted as a "business disappointment" due to its
    small amount of sold copies. It was succeeded by Windows 95, and Microsoft
    ended the support for Windows 3.1 series on December 31, 2001, except for
    the embedded version, which was retired in 2008.

  <p>
    Windows 95 is the first OS in the Windows 9x family of operating systems,
    released to manufacturing on July 14, 1995, and generally to retail on
    August 24, 1995. Windows 95 merged Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and
    Microsoft Windows products, and featured significant improvements over its
    predecessor, most notably in the graphical user interface (GUI) and in its
    simplified "plug-and-play" features. There were also major changes made to
    the core components of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly
    cooperatively multitasked 16-bit architecture of its predecessor Windows 3.1
    to a 32-bit preemptive multitasking architecture.

  <p>
    Windows NT 4.0 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system
    developed by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the direct
    successor to Windows NT 3.51, and was released to manufacturing on July 31,
    1996, and then to retail in August 24, 1996, with the Server versions
    released to retail in September 1996. Windows NT 4.0 is a preemptively
    multitasked, 32-bit operating system that is designed to work with either
    uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor PCs. It was Microsoft's primary
    business-oriented operating system until the release of Windows 2000. Three
    editions were sold - Workstation, Server and Embedded editions, and each
    edition featured a Graphical User Interface UI similar to that of Windows
    95. Windows NT 4.0 was the last public release of Microsoft Windows for the
    Alpha, MIPS, and PowerPC architectures.

  </h2>
  <p>
    Windows 98 was the second operating system in the 9x line, as the successor
    to Windows 95. It was released to manufacturing on May 15, 1998, and to
    retail on June 25, 1998. Like its predecessor, it was a hybrid 16-bit and
    32-bit monolithic product with the boot stage based on MS-DOS. Windows 98 is
    web-integrated and bears many similarities to its predecessor, Windows 95.
    Most of its improvements were either cosmetic or designed to improve the
    user experience, but there were also a handful of features introduced to
    enhance the system functionality and capabilities, which included improved
    USB support, accessibility, and support for hardware advancements such as
    DVD players. Windows 98 was the first edition of Windows to adopt the
    Windows Driver Model, and introduced features that would become standard in
    future generations of Windows, such as Disk Cleanup, Windows Update,
    multi-monitor support, and Internet Connection Sharing.

    Windows 2000 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed
    by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the direct successor to
    Windows NT 4.0, and was released to manufacturing on December 15, 1999,
    officially released to retail on February 17, 2000 for all versions, and on
    September 26, 2000 for Windows 2000 Datacenter Server. It was Microsoft's
    primary business-oriented operating system until the introduction of Windows
    XP Professional in 2001.

  <p>
    Windows Me (Millennium Edition) is an operating system developed by
    Microsoft as the last operating system in the Windows 9x series of Microsoft
    Windows operating systems. It was the successor to Windows 98, and was
    released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, and to retail on September 14,
    2000. It was Microsoft's main operating system for home users and quickly
    replaced by its successor Windows XP on October 25, 2001.

  <p>
    Windows XP is a major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating systems.
    It was released to manufacturing on August 24, 2001, and later to retail on
    October 25, 2001. It is a direct successor to Windows 2000 for high-end and
    business users and Windows Me for home users. Development began under the
    codename "Neptune", a version built on the NT kernel and targeted towards
    consumers. An updated version of Windows 2000, "Odyssey", was also planned
    for the business sector. However, in January 2000, both Windows Odyssey and
    Neptune were scrapped and replaced by a single unified operating system
    codenamed "Whistler" based on the Windows NT kernel, which would serve both
    home consumers and business markets. This occured as they realized that both
    were going to based on the same Windows 2000 codebase. Therefore, Windows XP
    is the first consumer edition of Windows which is not based on the Windows
    95 kernel or MS-DOS. Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486, and SGI
    Visual Workstation 320 and 540 architecture, and only runs on 32-bit x86
    CPUs and devices that use BIOS firmware.

    Windows Vista is a major release of the Windows NT series of operating
    systems developed by Microsoft. It was the direct successor to Windows XP,
    which was released five years earlier. This was then the longest time span
    between successive releases of Microsoft Windows. It was released to
    manufacturing on November 8, 2006, and over the following two months, it was
    released in stages to business customers, original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs), and retail channels. On January 30, 2007, it was released
    internationally and was made available for purchase and download from the
    Windows Marketplace; it is the first release of Windows to be made available
    through a digital distribution platform.

    Windows 7 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
    Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on July 22, 2009, and became
    generally available on October 22, 2009. It is the successor to Windows
    Vista, released nearly three years earlier. Windows 7's server counterpart,
    Windows Server 2008 R2, was released at the same time. It was succeeded by
    Windows 8 in October 2012. Extended support ended on January 14, 2020, over
    ten years after the release of Windows 7, after which the operating system
    ceased receiving further updates. A paid support program was available for
    enterprises, providing security updates for Windows 7 for up to three years
    after the official end of life. Windows 7 was intended to be an incremental
    upgrade to Microsoft Windows, addressing Windows Vista's poor critical
    reception while maintaining hardware and software compatibility. Windows 7
    continued improvements on the Windows Aero user interface with the addition
    of a redesigned taskbar that allows pinned applications, and new window
    management features. Other new features were added to the operating system
    which included libraries, the new file-sharing system HomeGroup, and support
    for multitouch input. A new "Action Center" was added to provide an overview
    of system security and maintenance information, and the User Account Control
    system was slightly modified to make it less intrusive. Windows 7 also
    shipped with updated versions of several stock applications, including
    Internet Explorer 8, Windows Media Player, and Windows Media Center.

    Windows 8 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
    Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on August 1, 2012, made
    available for download via MSDN and TechNet on August 15, 2012, and
    generally released for retail on October 26, 2012. Windows 8 introduced
    major changes to the operating system's platform and user interface with the
    intention to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows was
    competing with mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS. These
    changes included a Windows shell and GUI optimised for touchscreeen devices,
    along with a start screen based on Microsoft's new Metro design language,
    integration with online services, the Windows Store, and a new keyboard
    shortcut for screenshots. Many of these features were adapted from Windows
    Phone. Windows 8 also added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format, near-field
    communication, and cloud computing, as well as a new lock screen with clock
    and notifications. Additional security features—including built-in antivirus
    software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering, and
    support for Secure Boot on supported devices—were introduced. It was the
    first Windows version to support ARM architecture under the Windows RT
    branding. CPUs without PAE, SSE2 and NX are unsupported in this version.

  <p>
    Windows 8.1 is a release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
    Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on August 27, 2013, and broadly
    released for retail sale on October 17, 2013, about a year after the retail
    release of its predecessor, and succeeded by Windows 10 on July 29, 2015.
    Windows 8.1 was made available for download via MSDN and Technet and
    available as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows RT
    users via the Windows Store. A server version, Windows Server 2012 R2, was
    released on October 18, 2013. Windows 8.1 aimed to address complaints of
    Windows 8 users and reviewers on launch. Enhancements include an improved
    Start screen, additional snap views, additional bundled apps, tighter
    OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) integration, Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), a
    Bing-powered unified search system, restoration of a visible Start button on
    the taskbar, and the ability to restore the previous behavior of opening the
    user's desktop on login instead of the Start screen. Windows 8.1 also added
    support for then emerging technologies like high-resolution displays, 3D
    printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming, as well as the ReFS file
    system.

    for download via MSDN and TechNet, as a free upgrade for retail copies of
    Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users via the Microsoft Store, and to Windows 7
    users via Windows Update. Unlike previous Windows NT releases, Windows 10
    receives new builds on an ongoing basis, which are available at no
    additional cost to users; devices in enterprise environments can
    alternatively use long-term support milestones that only receive critical
    updates, such as security patches. Windows 10 is the last version of
    Microsoft Windows that supports 32-bit processors (IA-32 and ARMv7-based),
    the last non-IoT edition to officially lack a CPU whitelist and support BIOS
    firmware, and the last version to officially support systems with TPM 1.2 or
    without any TPM at all. Support for Windows 10 editions which are not in the
    Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) is set to end on October 14, 2025.

    system, released on October 5, 2021. It succeeded Windows 10 (2015), and is
    available for free for any Windows 10 devices that meet the new Windows 11
    system requirements. Windows 11 features major changes to the Windows shell
    influenced by the canceled Windows 10X, including a redesigned Start menu,
    the replacement of its "live tiles" with a separate "Widgets" panel on the
    taskbar, the ability to create tiled sets of windows that can be minimized
    and restored from the taskbar as a group, and new gaming technologies
    inherited from Xbox Series X and Series S such as Auto HDR and DirectStorage
    on compatible hardware. Internet Explorer (IE) has been replaced by the
    Chromium-based Microsoft Edge as the default web browser, like its
    predecessor, Windows 10, and Microsoft Teams is integrated into the Windows
    shell. Microsoft also announced plans to allow more flexibility in software
    that can be distributed via the Microsoft Store and to support Android apps
    on Windows 11.
