  Windows 1.0 was the first major version of the Microsoft Windows series of
  Operating Systems, released on November 20, 1985 for US and to European
  nations in May of 1986. It marked a significant step in the evolution of
  Personal Computers (PCs). It wasn't a full-fledged operating system; it was
  only a graphical shell that ran on top of MS-DOS (mentioned in Other Notable
  Versions of Windows, check it out after reading this). This approach
  introduced a user-friendly interface with icons and windows, compared to the
  command-line DOS-interface, which made computers more accessible to a wider
  audience.

<p>
  Development began when Bill Gates saw a demonstration of a similar piece of
  software, <b>Visi On</b> at COMDEX in 1982. Windows 1.0 runs on MS-DOS, as a
  16-bit shell program known as MS-DOS Executive, and provides an environment
  which can run graphical programs designed for Windows as well as MS-DOS
  compatible programs. It included multi-tasking, the use of the mouse, and
  various built-in programs like Calculator, Paint, and Notepad, which can still
  be found today. It does not, however, allow its windows to overlap, rather the
  windows are tiled. Windows 1.0 had 4 releases 1.01 through 1.04, adding
  support for more languages or newer hardware.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="development">Development</h2>
<p>
  Microsoft showed its desire to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) as
  early as 1981. Development of Windows began after Bill Gates, co-founder of
  Microsoft as well as developer of Windows, saw a demonstration at COMDEX 1982
  of VisiCorp's Visi On, a GUI software suite for IBM PC compatible computers. A
  year later, Microsoft learned that Apple's own GUI software—also bit-mapped,
  and based in part on research from Xerox PARC—was much more advanced.
  Microsoft decided it needed to differentiate its own offering. In August 1983,
  Gates recruited Scott A. McGregor, one of the key developers behind PARC's
  original windowing system, to be the developer team lead for Windows 1.0.
</p>
<p>
  Microsoft first demonstrated a window manager to the press in September 1983.
  The demonstration featured a user interface similar to Multiplan and other
  contemporary Microsoft applications with a command bar at the bottom of the
  screen. It also showed multiple application windows in both overlapping and
  tiled arrangements. This user interface concept was soon reworked to only
  support tiled windows and to change the Multiplan-like command bar into a menu
  bar under each window's title bar. The redesigned environment ultimately had
  its public debut at Fall COMDEX 1983 in November 1983. Initially requiring 192
  KB of RAM and two floppy disk drives, Microsoft described the software as a
  device driver for MS-DOS 2.0. By supporting cooperative multitasking in tiled
  windows when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS system calls
  and permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, Windows
  differed from both Visi On and Apple Computer's Lisa by immediately offering
  many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows developers did not need to use Unix
  to develop IBM PC applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other
  companies, including competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not
  requiring a Microsoft user interface in their applications.
</p>
<p>
  Manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as Compaq, Zenith, and DEC promised to
  provide support, as did software companies such as Ashton-Tate and Lotus.
  After previewing Windows, BYTE magazine stated in December 1983 that it "seems
  to offer remarkable openness, reconfigurability, and transportability as well
  as modest hardware requirements and pricing … Barring a surprise product
  introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows will be the first
  large-scale test of the desktop metaphor in the hands of its intended users."
  From early in Windows's history, Gates viewed it as Microsoft's future. He
  told InfoWorld magazine in April 1984 that "our strategies and energies as a
  company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that we're committed
  to operating-system kernels like MS-DOS and Xenix. We're also saying that only
  applications that take advantage of Windows will be competitive in the long
  run." IBM was absent from Microsoft's announcement and rejected Windows in
  favor of creating its own product called TopView. By late 1984, the press
  reported a "War of the Windows" between Microsoft Windows, IBM's TopView, and
  Digital Research's Graphics Environment Manager (GEM). Steve Ballmer replaced
  McGregor after he left the team in January 1985.
</p>
<p>
  In November 1983, Microsoft promised to ship Windows by April 1984. But due to
  multiple design modifications, its release date was delayed. During its
  development and before its windowing system was developed, it was briefly
  referred to by the codename "Interface Manager". De-emphasizing multitasking,
  the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of TopView, was to "turn
  the computer into a graphics-rich environment" while using less memory. After
  Microsoft persuaded IBM that the latter needed a GUI, the two companies
  announced in April 1987 the introduction of OS/2 and its graphical OS/2
  Presentation Manager, which were supposed to ultimately replace both MS-DOS
  and Windows.
</p>
<p>
  On November 20, 1985, the first retail release, Windows 1.01, was released in
  the United States at a cost of US$99 (equivalent to about $280.00 in 2023). In
  May 1986, the next release, 1.02, was published mainly for the European
  market, also introducing non-English versions of Windows 1.0. The version
  1.03, released in August 1986, included enhancements that made it consistent
  with the international release like drivers for non-U.S. keyboards and
  additional screen and printer drivers, and superseded both version 1.01 in the
  US and version 1.02 in Europe. Version 1.04, released in April 1987, added
  support for the new IBM PS/2 computers, although no support for PS/2 mice or
  new VGA graphics modes was provided. However, on May 27, 1987, an OEM version
  was released by IBM, which added VGA support, PS/2 mouse support, MCGA
  support, and support for the 8514/A display driver. IBM released this version
  on three 3.5-inch 720k floppies and offered it as part of their "Personal
  Publishing System" and "Collegiate Kit" bundles. Microsoft ended its support
  for Windows 1.0 on December 31, 2001, making it the longest-supported version
  out of all versions of Windows.

<h2 class="level-one" id="features">Features</h2>
<p>
  Windows 1.0 was built on the MS-DOS kernel, while it runs as a 16-bit shell
  program known as the MS-DOS Executive, and it offers limited multitasking of
  existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an interaction paradigm
  (cf. message loop), an execution model and a stable API for native programs
  for the future. The operating environment supports the use of a mouse, which
  allows users to perform click-and-drag operations. Contrary to modern Windows
  operating systems, the mouse button had to be kept pressed to display the
  selected menu.
</p>

<p>
  Opening .exe files in the MS-DOS Executive would open an application window.
  Windows 1.0 also includes programs such as the Calculator, Paint (then known
  as Paintbrush, only supported monochrome graphics), Notepad, Write, Terminal,
  and Clock. The operating environment also has the Cardfile manager, a
  Clipboard, and a Print Spooler program. Initially, Puzzle and Chess were
  supposed to appear as playable video games, although Microsoft scrapped the
  idea; instead, it introduced Reversi as a commercially published video game.
  It was included in Windows 1.0 as a built-in application, and it relies on
  mouse control. The operating environment also introduced the Control Panel,
  which was used to configure the features of Windows 1.0. The operating
  environment does not allow overlapping windows, and instead, the windows are
  tiled. When a program gets minimized, its icon would appear on a horizontal
  line at the bottom of the screen, which resembles the modern-day Windows
  taskbar.
</p>

<p>
  It consists of three dynamic-link libraries, which are located as files in the
  system under the names KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE. The Windows 1.0 SDK
  contains debugging versions of these files, which can be used to replace the
  corresponding files on the setup disks. The setup program combines multiple
  system files into one, so that Windows boots faster. Using the debugging
  KERNEL.EXE provided by the Windows 1.0 SDK one can create a "slow boot"
  version of Windows, where the files are separate. Windows 1.0 includes a
  kernel, which performs functions such as task handling, memory management, and
  input and output of files, while the two other dynamic-link libraries are the
  user interface and Graphics Device Interface. The operating environment could
  also move the program code and data segments in memory, to allow programs to
  share code and data that are located in dynamic-link libraries. Windows 1.0
  implemented the use of code segment swapping.
</p>

<p>
  Version 1.02 introduced drivers for European keyboards, as well as screen and
  print drivers. The last Windows 1.0 release, 1.04, introduced support for IBM
  PS/2 computers. Due to Microsoft's extensive support for backward
  compatibility, it is not only possible to execute Windows 1.0 binary programs
  on current versions of Windows to a large extent but also to recompile their
  source code into an equally functional "modern" application with limited
  modifications.
</p>

<p>
  In March 2022, it was discovered that the operating environment also includes
  an easter egg that lists the developers who worked on the operating
  environment along with a message that says "Congrats!"
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>
  The GUI consisted of icons which could be clicked on to open files and
  programs. The desktop contained icons, windows in which programs ran, dropdown
  menus, and a line at the bottom that displayed running programs, similar to
  the modern-day taskbar on Windows. The Program Manager was unsophisticated,
  consisiting of a list of files that referred to a location on the disk. These
  could be programs, pictures, text files or other types of files. To change the
  wallpaper, system files had to be edited, which was very dangerous. Buttons
  were always in a pill shape, except for the control buttons like maximize and
  minimize, which were squares. Multitasking is cooperative, which means
  programs could not run at the same time. Instead, they take turns using the
  processor. Windows could not overlap, instead being tiled.
