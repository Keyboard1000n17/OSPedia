<span id="heading">Windows 1.0</span>

<p>
  Windows 1.0 was the first major version of the Microsoft Windows series of
  Operating Systems, released on November 20, 1985 for US and to European
  nations in May of 1986. It marked a significant step in the evolution of
  Personal Computers (PCs). It wasn't a full-fledged operating system; it was
  only a graphical shell that ran on top of MS-DOS (mentioned in Other Notable
  Versions of Windows, check it out after reading this). This approach
  introduced a user-friendly interface with icons and windows, compared to the
  command-line DOS-interface, which made computers more accessible to a wider
  audience.

  Development began when Bill Gates saw a demonstration of a similar piece of
  software, <b>Visi On</b> at COMDEX in 1982. Windows 1.0 runs on MS-DOS, as a
  16-bit shell program known as MS-DOS Executive, and provides an environment
  which can run graphical programs designed for Windows as well as MS-DOS
  compatible programs. It included multi-tasking, the use of the mouse, and
  various built-in programs like Calculator, Paint, and Notepad, which can still
  be found today. It does not, however, allow its windows to overlap, rather the
  windows are tiled. Windows 1.0 had 4 releases 1.01 through 1.04, adding
  support for more languages or newer hardware.
</p>

  <summary class="level-one">Development History</summary>
  <p>
    Microsoft showed its desire to develop a graphical user interface (GUI) as
    early as 1981. Development of Windows began after Bill Gates, co-founder of
    Microsoft as well as developer of Windows, saw a demonstration at COMDEX
    1982 of VisiCorp's Visi On, a GUI software suite for IBM PC compatible
    computers. A year later, Microsoft learned that Apple's own GUI
    software—also bit-mapped, and based in part on research from Xerox PARC—was
    much more advanced. Microsoft decided it needed to differentiate its own
    offering. In August 1983, Gates recruited Scott A. McGregor, one of the key
    developers behind PARC's original windowing system, to be the developer team
    lead for Windows 1.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    Microsoft first demonstrated a window manager to the press in September
    1983. The demonstration featured a user interface similar to Multiplan and
    other contemporary Microsoft applications with a command bar at the bottom
    of the screen. It also showed multiple application windows in both
    overlapping and tiled arrangements. This user interface concept was soon
    reworked to only support tiled windows and to change the Multiplan-like
    command bar into a menu bar under each window's title bar. The redesigned
    environment ultimately had its public debut at Fall COMDEX 1983 in November
    1983. Initially requiring 192 KB of RAM and two floppy disk drives,
    Microsoft described the software as a device driver for MS-DOS 2.0. By
    supporting cooperative multitasking in tiled windows when using well-behaved
    applications that only used DOS system calls and permitting non-well-behaved
    applications to run in a full screen, Windows differed from both Visi On and
    Apple Computer's Lisa by immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi
    On, Windows developers did not need to use Unix to develop IBM PC
    applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including
    competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft
    user interface in their applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as Compaq, Zenith, and DEC promised
    to provide support, as did software companies such as Ashton-Tate and Lotus.
    After previewing Windows, BYTE magazine stated in December 1983 that it
    "seems to offer remarkable openness, reconfigurability, and transportability
    as well as modest hardware requirements and pricing … Barring a surprise
    product introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows will be the
    first large-scale test of the desktop metaphor in the hands of its intended
    users." From early in Windows's history, Gates viewed it as Microsoft's
    future. He told InfoWorld magazine in April 1984 that "our strategies and
    energies as a company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that
    we're committed to operating-system kernels like MS-DOS and Xenix. We're
    also saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be
    competitive in the long run." IBM was absent from Microsoft's announcement
    and rejected Windows in favor of creating its own product called TopView. By
    late 1984, the press reported a "War of the Windows" between Microsoft
    Windows, IBM's TopView, and Digital Research's Graphics Environment Manager
    (GEM). Steve Ballmer replaced McGregor after he left the team in January
    1985.
  </p>
  <p>
    In November 1983, Microsoft promised to ship Windows by April 1984. But due
    to multiple design modifications, its release date was delayed. During its
    development and before its windowing system was developed, it was briefly
    referred to by the codename "Interface Manager". De-emphasizing
    multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of
    TopView, was to "turn the computer into a graphics-rich environment" while
    using less memory. After Microsoft persuaded IBM that the latter needed a
    GUI, the two companies announced in April 1987 the introduction of OS/2 and
    its graphical OS/2 Presentation Manager, which were supposed to ultimately
    replace both MS-DOS and Windows.

    On November 20, 1985, the first retail release, Windows 1.01, was released
    in the United States at a cost of US$99 (equivalent to about $280.00 in
    2023). In May 1986, the next release, 1.02, was published mainly for the
    European market, also introducing non-English versions of Windows 1.0. The
    version 1.03, released in August 1986, included enhancements that made it
    consistent with the international release like drivers for non-U.S.
    keyboards and additional screen and printer drivers, and superseded both
    version 1.01 in the US and version 1.02 in Europe. Version 1.04, released in
    April 1987, added support for the new IBM PS/2 computers, although no
    support for PS/2 mice or new VGA graphics modes was provided. However, on
    May 27, 1987, an OEM version was released by IBM, which added VGA support,
    PS/2 mouse support, MCGA support, and support for the 8514/A display driver.
    IBM released this version on three 3.5-inch 720k floppies and offered it as
    part of their "Personal Publishing System" and "Collegiate Kit" bundles.
    Microsoft ended its support for Windows 1.0 on December 31, 2001, making it
    the longest-supported version out of all versions of Windows.

  <p>
    Windows 1.0 was built on the MS-DOS kernel, while it runs as a 16-bit shell
    program known as the MS-DOS Executive, and it offers limited multitasking of
    existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an interaction
    paradigm (cf. message loop), an execution model and a stable API for native
    programs for the future. The operating environment supports the use of a
    mouse, which allows users to perform click-and-drag operations. Contrary to
    modern Windows operating systems, the mouse button had to be kept pressed to
    display the selected menu.
  </p>

  <p>
    Opening .exe files in the MS-DOS Executive would open an application window.
    Windows 1.0 also includes programs such as the Calculator, Paint (then known
    as Paintbrush, only supported monochrome graphics), Notepad, Write,
    Terminal, and Clock. The operating environment also has the Cardfile
    manager, a Clipboard, and a Print Spooler program. Initially, Puzzle and
    Chess were supposed to appear as playable video games, although Microsoft
    scrapped the idea; instead, it introduced Reversi as a commercially
    published video game. It was included in Windows 1.0 as a built-in
    application, and it relies on mouse control. The operating environment also
    introduced the Control Panel, which was used to configure the features of
    Windows 1.0. The operating environment does not allow overlapping windows,
    and instead, the windows are tiled. When a program gets minimized, its icon
    would appear on a horizontal line at the bottom of the screen, which
    resembles the modern-day Windows taskbar.
  </p>

  <p>
    It consists of three dynamic-link libraries, which are located as files in
    the system under the names KERNEL.EXE, USER.EXE, and GDI.EXE. The Windows
    1.0 SDK contains debugging versions of these files, which can be used to
    replace the corresponding files on the setup disks. The setup program
    combines multiple system files into one, so that Windows boots faster. Using
    the debugging KERNEL.EXE provided by the Windows 1.0 SDK one can create a
    "slow boot" version of Windows, where the files are separate. Windows 1.0
    includes a kernel, which performs functions such as task handling, memory
    management, and input and output of files, while the two other dynamic-link
    libraries are the user interface and Graphics Device Interface. The
    operating environment could also move the program code and data segments in
    memory, to allow programs to share code and data that are located in
    dynamic-link libraries. Windows 1.0 implemented the use of code segment
    swapping.
  </p>

  <p>
    Version 1.02 introduced drivers for European keyboards, as well as screen
    and print drivers. The last Windows 1.0 release, 1.04, introduced support
    for IBM PS/2 computers. Due to Microsoft's extensive support for backward
    compatibility, it is not only possible to execute Windows 1.0 binary
    programs on current versions of Windows to a large extent but also to
    recompile their source code into an equally functional "modern" application
    with limited modifications.
  </p>

  <p>
    In March 2022, it was discovered that the operating environment also
    includes an easter egg that lists the developers who worked on the operating
    environment along with a message that says "Congrats!"

  <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
  <p>
    The GUI consisted of icons which could be clicked on to open files and
    programs. The desktop contained icons, windows in which programs ran,
    dropdown menus, and a line at the bottom that displayed running programs,
    similar to the modern-day taskbar on Windows. The Program Manager was
    unsophisticated, consisiting of a list of files that referred to a location
    on the disk. These could be programs, pictures, text files or other types of
    files. To change the wallpaper, system files had to be edited, which was
    very dangerous. Buttons were always in a pill shape, except for the control
    buttons like maximize and minimize, which were squares. Multitasking is
    cooperative, which means programs could not run at the same time. Instead,
    they take turns using the processor. Windows could not overlap, instead
    being tiled.
