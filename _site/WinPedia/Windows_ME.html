    Windows Me (Millennium Edition) is an operating system developed by
    Microsoft as the last operating system in the Windows 9x series of Microsoft
    Windows operating systems. It was the successor to Windows 98, and was
    released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000, and to retail on September 14,
    2000. It was Microsoft's main operating system for home users and quickly
    replaced by its successor Windows XP on October 25, 2001.

    Windows Me was targeted specifically at home PC users, and included Internet
    Explorer 5.5, which could later be upgraded to Internet Explorer 6; Windows
    Media Player 7, which could later be upgraded to Windows Media Player 9
    Series; DirectX 7, which could later be upgraded to DirectX 9; and the new
    Windows Movie Maker software, which provided basic video editing and was
    designed to be easy to use for consumers. Microsoft also incorporated
    features first introduced in Windows 2000, which had been released as a
    business-oriented operating system seven months earlier, into the graphical
    user interface, shell and Windows Explorer. Although Windows Me was still
    based on MS-DOS like its predecessors, access to real-mode DOS was
    restricted to decrease system boot time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Windows Me was initially positively received when it was released, but it
    quickly recieved a more infamous reputation from many users due to lots of
    stability problems. In October 2001, Windows XP was released to the public,
    having already been under development at the time of Windows Me's release,
    and incorporated most, but not all, of the features of Windows Me, while
    still being far more stable due to being based on the Windows NT kernel.
    Mainstream support for Windows Me ended on December 31, 2003, followed by
    extended support on July 11, 2006.

    <summary class="level-one">Development</summary>
    <p>
      At the 1998 Windows Hardware Engineering Conference, Microsoft CEO Bill
      Gates stated that Windows 98 would be the last iteration of Windows to use
      the Windows 9x kernel, with the intention for the next consumer-focused
      version to be based on the Windows NT kernel, unifying the two branches of
      Windows. However, it soon became apparent that the development work
      involved was too great to meet the aim of releasing before the end of
      2000, particularly given the ongoing parallel work on the
      eventually-canceled Neptune project. The Consumer Windows development team
      was therefore re-tasked with improving Windows 98 while porting some of
      the look-and-feel from Windows 2000. Microsoft President Steve Ballmer
      publicly announced these changes at the next Windows HEIC in 1999.
    </p>
    <p>
      On July 23, 1999, the first alpha version of Windows Me was released to
      testers. Known as Development Preview 1, it was very similar to Windows 98
      SE, with the only major change being a very early iteration of the new
      Help and Support feature that would appear in the final version. Three
      more Development Previews were released over the subsequent two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first beta version was released to testers and the industry press on
      September 24, 1999, with the second coming on November 24 that year. Beta
      2 showed the first real changes from Windows 98, including importing much
      of the look-and-feel from Windows 2000, and the removal of real-mode DOS.
      Industry expert Paul Thurrott reviewed Beta 2 upon release and spoke
      positively of it in a review. By early 2000, Windows Me was reportedly
      behind schedule, and an interim build containing the new automatic update
      feature was released to allay concerns about a delayed-release.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February 2000, Paul Thurrott revealed that Microsoft had planned to
      exclude Windows Me, as well as new releases of Windows NT 4.0, from CD
      shipments for MSDN subscribers. The reason given in the case of Me was
      that the OS was designed for consumers. However, Thurrott alleged that the
      real motivation behind both case to force software developers to move to
      Windows 2000. Three days later, following a write-in and call-in campaign
      by hundreds of readers, Microsoft announced that Windows Me (including
      development versions) would ship to MSDN subscribers after all. Microsoft
      also apologized personally to Thurrott, claiming he received
      misinformation, though in a follow-up article he stated that it was "clear
      that the decision [...] actually changed".
    </p>
    <p>
      Beta 3 was released on April 11, 2000, and this version marked the first
      appearance of its final startup and shutdown sounds derived from Windows
      2000, as the previous betas used Windows 98's startup and shutdown sounds.
    </p>

    <span style="font-size: 2.2vh; font-weight: 800">Release</span>
    <p>
      Although Microsoft signed off on the final build of Windows Me on June 28,
      2000, after trialing three Release Candidate builds with testers, the
      final retail release was pushed back to September 14 for reasons that were
      not clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after Windows Me was released to manufacturing on June 19, 2000,
      Microsoft launched a marketing campaign to promote it in the U.S., which
      they dubbed the Meet Me Tour. A national partnered promotional program
      featured the new OS, OEMs and other partners in an interactive multimedia
      attraction in 25 cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows Me was released for retail sale on September 14, 2000.At launch
      time, Microsoft announced a time-limited promotion from September 2000 to
      January 2001 which entitled Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE users to upgrade
      to Windows Me for $59.95 instead of the regular retail upgrade price of
      $109. Non-upgrade versions cost $209, the same as Windows 98 on its
      release. In October 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP, which also
      included the ZIP folders, the Spider Solitaire game and Internet Explorer
      6 by default, all while being based on the Windows NT kernel, which on XP
      was an evolution of the one in Windows 2000.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Hardware support improvements</summary>

      <p>
        Faster boot times: Windows Me features numerous improvements for
        improving cold boot time, pre and post-logon boot times and time
        required for resuming from hibernation. Processing of real mode
        configuration files, CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT, is bypassed at startup
        and essential real mode drivers like HIMEM.SYS and SMARTDRV.EXE are
        embedded into IO.SYS. The registry is loaded only once; for efficient
        loading, the registry is split into three files instead of two
        (SYSTEM.DAT and USER.DAT), with the new file CLASSES.DAT containing the
        contents of the hive HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT required for boot loaded
        initially. Plug and Play device enumeration is more parallelized than in
        Windows 98. Boot time is not affected due to unavailability of a DHCP
        server or other network components. There are also optimizations to
        prevent boot slowdown due to BIOS POST operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        USB Human Interface Device Class: Generic support for 5-button mice is
        also included as standard and installing IntelliPoint allows reassigning
        the programmable buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows Image Acquisition: Windows Me introduced the Windows Image
        Acquisition API for a standardized method of allowing Windows
        applications to transparently and more easily communicate with image
        acquisition devices, such as digital cameras and scanners. WIA intended
        to improve the configuration and the user interface for interacting with
        scanners and such devices, (which were previously supported by the TWAIN
        standard) and simplify writing device drivers for developers. WIA also
        includes support for USB still image capture device classes such as
        scanners and cameras through the Picture Transfer Protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Improved power management and suspend/resume operations: The OEM version
        of Windows Me supports OS-controlled ACPI S4 sleep state (hibernation)
        and other power management features without manufacturer-supplied
        drivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        USB and FireWire support improvements: Windows Me is the only operating
        system in the Windows 9x series that includes generic drivers for USB
        mass storage devices and USB printers. Support for FireWire SBP-2
        scanners and storage devices is also improved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The waveOut, DirectSound, and DirectShow APIs support non-PCM formats
        such as AC-3 or WMA over S/PDIF.

      <summary class="level-two">Media</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Windows Movie Maker: This utility is based on DirectShow and Windows
          Media technologies to provide Microsoft Windows computer systems with
          basic video capture and edit capabilities. It provides users with the
          ability to capture, edit, and re-encode media content into the Windows
          Media format, a tightly compressed format that requires a minimal
          amount of storage space on the computer's hard disk when compared to
          many other media formats.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Media Player 7: The new version of the Windows multimedia
          player software introduces jukebox functionality featuring the Media
          Library, support for CD burning, an integrated media encoder, and the
          ability to transfer music directly to portable devices. Another new
          feature is its radio tuner that can be used to search for and connect
          to radio stations over the internet. Users can also customize the look
          and feel of the user interface through interactive skins. Windows Me
          can be upgraded to Windows Media Player 9 Series, which was later
          included in Windows XP SP2.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows DVD Player: The software DVD player in Windows Me is a
          redesigned version of the one featured in Windows 98 which, unlike its
          predecessor, does not require a dedicated decoder card for DVD
          playback. Instead, it supports software decoding through a third-party
          decoder.
        </li>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Networking technologies</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Net Crawler: Windows Me introduced a net crawling feature which
          automatically searches out and creates shortcuts to network shares and
          printers in My Network Places. This can be controlled using the
          Automatically search for network folders and printers option.
          Shortcuts that are added by the net crawler but not detected again on
          the network in a reasonable time period are aged out and deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
          New TCP/IP Stack: Windows Me includes the Windows 2000 networking
          stack and architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Home Networking Wizard is designed to help users to set up a
          computer that is running Windows Me for use on a small home network.
          This includes setting up Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) on a
          computer running Windows Me so the computer can share a connection to
          the Internet with other computers on the home network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dial-up Networking component was updated in Windows Me and provides
          several enhancements while maintaining the desired features of prior
          releases of the operating system. The user interface had been reworked
          to provide all configurable parameters in one convenient location. The
          user interface now included three new tabs: Networking, Security and
          Dialing. To improve dial-up networking, Windows Me includes built-in
          support for the Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the
          Connection Manager Administration Kit (an optional networking
          component in Windows 2000 Server), network administrators can
          pre-configure and deploy dial-up networking connections, by means of a
          Connection Manager service profile, to Windows Me–based client
          machines.
        </li>
        <li>
          Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) version 5.0 for Windows
          Me was enhanced to provide programming interface parity with NDIS
          version 5.0 in Windows 2000 (the programming interfaces used by
          network device drivers are the same for both platforms).
        </li>
        <li>
          Universal Plug and Play: Windows Me introduced support for Universal
          Plug and Play (UPnP). Universal Plug and Play and NAT traversal APIs
          can also be installed on Windows 98 and Windows 98 SE by installing
          the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">System utilities</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          System Restore: Windows Me introduced the "System Restore" logging and
          reversion system, which was meant to simplify troubleshooting and
          solve problems. It was intended to work as a rollback and recovery
          feature so that if the installation of an application or a driver
          adversely affected the system, the user could undo the installation
          and return the system to a previously working state. It does this by
          monitoring changes to Windows system files and the registry. System
          Restore protects only the operating system files, not documents, and
          therefore is not a substitute for a backup program.
        </li>
        <li>
          System File Protection: First introduced with Windows 2000 (as Windows
          File Protection), and expanding on the capabilities introduced with
          System File Checker in Windows 98, System File Protection aimed to
          protect system files from modification and corruption silently and
          automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or
          deleting a system file causes Windows Me to silently restore the
          original copy. The original is taken from a hard drive backup folder
          (%WinDir%\Options\Install) or from the Windows Me installation CD, if
          the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no
          installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about
          the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. System File
          Protection is a different technology from System Restore and should
          not be confused with the latter. System Restore maintains a broad set
          of changed files including added applications and user configuration
          data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the
          user, whereas System File Protection protects operating system files
          with no user input.
        </li>
        <li>
          System Configuration Utility allows users to manually extract and
          restore individual system files from the Windows Me setup files. It
          has also been updated with three new tabs called "Static VxDs",
          "Environment" and "International". The Static VxDs tab allows users to
          enable or disable static virtual device drivers to be loaded at
          startup, the Environment tab allows users to enable or disable
          environment variables, and the International tab allows users to set
          international language keyboard layout settings that were formerly set
          via the real mode MS-DOS configuration files. A Cleanup button on the
          Startup tab allows cleaning up invalid or deleted startup entries.
        </li>
        <li>
          System Monitor has been updated with a Dial-Up Adapter section. Users
          can now monitor items such as Connection Speeds, Bytes Received or
          Transmitted / Second.
        </li>
        <li>
          SCANDISK runs from within Windows upon an improper shutdown before the
          Windows Shell loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Automatic Updates: The Automatic Updates utility automatically
          downloads and installs critical updates from the Windows Update Web
          site with little user interaction. It is set up to check Windows
          Update once every 24 hours by default. Users can choose to download
          which update they want, although high-priority updates must be
          downloaded and installed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Compressed Folders: Windows Me includes native support for ZIP files
          through the 'Compressed Folders' Explorer extension. This extension
          was originally introduced in the Plus! 98 collection for Windows 98,
          but is included in the base operating system in Windows Me.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new Help and Support program has also been added, replacing the HTML
          Help-based documentation in Windows 2000 and Windows 98. The Help and
          Support Center is entirely HTML-based and takes advantage of a
          technology called Support Automation Framework (SAF), that can show
          support information from the internet, allows collecting data for
          troubleshooting via WMI and scripting and for third parties to plug
          into Windows Help and Support. Several other support tools also
          shipped with Windows Me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Windows Me also includes Internet Explorer 5.5, which supports a new
          Print Preview feature. It also shipped with the MSN Messenger Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Accessibility features</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          On-Screen Keyboard: Originally introduced with Windows 2000, On-Screen
          Keyboard makes it possible to input characters using the mouse instead
          of the keyboard.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Mouse Control Panel incorporates IntelliPoint features, namely
          ClickLock (selecting or dragging without continuously holding down the
          mouse button), hiding the pointer while typing, and showing it by
          pressing Ctrl.
        </li>
        <li>The cursor (system caret) can be set to a thicker width.</li>
        <li>
          Increased Active Accessibility support in utilities such as Calculator
          and Magnifier.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Removed features</summary>

      <span class="level-two">Real mode DOS</span>

      <p>
        Windows Me restricted support for real mode MS-DOS. As a result, IO.SYS
        in Windows Me disregards CONFIG.SYS, COMMAND.COM and WIN.COM and
        directly executes VMM32.VXD. In its default configuration the system
        would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to DOS from
        Windows; real mode drivers such as ANSI.SYS could not be loaded and
        older applications that require real mode could not be run. Microsoft
        argued that the change improved the speed and reliability of the boot
        process.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Windows Me, the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are used only to
        set global environment variables. The two files (if present) are scanned
        for settings relating to the environment variables, and any other
        commands present are moved into a Windows registry key (see below). The
        two files thus contain only settings and preferences which configure the
        "global environment" for the computer during the boot phase or when
        starting a new virtual DOS machine (VDM).
      </p>

      <p>
        To specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would be
        present in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) the user must edit the following
        Windows registry key:
      </p>

      <code
        >HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\Environment</code
      >
      <p>
        For troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM and
        the Windows Me startup disk (a user-creatable floppy disk, known as the
        Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode MS-DOS.
      </p>

        It is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through various
        unofficial means. Additionally, a registry setting exists that
        re-enables the "Restart in MS-DOS mode" option in the shutdown dialog
        box; however, unless patched unofficially with third-party software,
        Windows Me cannot be booted to MS-DOS real mode.

        Unlike previous versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely aimed at
        home users, and thus had certain enterprise-oriented features removed.
        Several features of its predecessors did not work or were officially
        unsupported by Microsoft on Windows Me, including Automated
        Installation, Active Directory client services, System Policy Editor,
        Personal Web Server and ASP. These features were supported on the
        previous versions of Windows 9x. A Resource Kit publication, targeted
        towards system administrators, was never published for Windows Me.

        Other features that were removed or never updated to work with Windows
        Me included Microsoft Fax, QuickView and DriveSpace, as well as the GUI
        FAT32 conversion tool. Several Windows Explorer commands were also
        modified in Windows Me, matching the menu structure in Windows 2000.
        While some were simply moved to a different location, certain
        functionality of the Go menu, as well as the Find command on the Tools
        menu, are no longer available. For the latter change Microsoft
        recommends using a variety of similar functionality labeled Search.

        The Active Channels Channel bar from the original release of Windows 98
        was removed like with Windows 98 Second Edition and is not installed
        upon first boot, but is retained if upgrading from the original release
        of Windows 98 to Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows Me, like Windows 98 Second Edition, did not ship with the WinG
        API or RealPlayer 4.0, unlike the original release of Windows 98, due to
        both of these having been superseded by DirectX and Windows Media
        Player, respectively.

    <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
    <p>
      Windows Me featured the shell enhancements inherited from Windows 2000
      such as personalized menus, customizable Windows Explorer toolbars,
      auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, Windows 2000
      advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts
      as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider
      interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer,
      sort by name function for menus, Places bar in common dialogs for Open and
      Save, cascading Start menu special folders, some Plus! 95 and Plus! 98
      themes, and updated graphics. The notification area in Windows Me and
      later supported 16-bit high color icons. The Multimedia control panel was
      also updated from Windows 98. Taskbar and Start Menu options allowed
      disabling of the drag and drop feature and could prevent moving or
      resizing the taskbar, which was easier for new users.
