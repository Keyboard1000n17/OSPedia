<h1 id="heading">Windows 95</h1>

<p>
  Windows 95 is a consumer-oriented operating system developed by Microsoft and
  the first OS in the Windows 9x family of operating systems, released to
  manufacturing on July 14, 1995, and generally to retail on August 24, 1995.
  Windows 95 merged Microsoft's formerly separate MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows
  products, and featured significant improvements over its predecessor, most
  notably in the graphical user interface (GUI) and in its simplified
  "plug-and-play" features. There were also major changes made to the core
  components of the operating system, such as moving from a mainly cooperatively
  multitasked 16-bit architecture of its predecessor Windows 3.1 to a 32-bit
  preemptive multitasking architecture.

  <p>Date released: July 14, 1995</p>
  <p>
    End of Support: Mainstream - December 31, 2001<br />
    Extended: December 31, 2001
  </p>
  <p>Last release: OEM Service Release 2.5 on November 26, 1997</p>
  <p>
    Succeeded by: Windows NT 4.0 (released 1996)<br />Windows 98 (released 1998)
  </p>
  <p>Codename: Chicago</p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>

<p>
  Windows 95 introduced multiple functions and features that are still an
  important component of the GUI in later Windows versions, which include the
  taskbar, notification area, and the Start button which summons the Start menu.
  Accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign that generated a lot prerelease
  hype, it was a major success and is considered to be one of the biggest and
  most important products in the personal computing industry. Microsoft ended
  mainstream support for Windows 95 on December 31, 2000. Like Windows NT 3.51,
  which was released shortly before, Windows 95 received only one year of
  extended support, ending on December 31, 2001.
</p>
<p>
  The most notable difference between Windows 95 and previous versions of
  Windows, as previously mentioned, was the Graphical User Interface. The User
  Interface was overhauled and and new elements were added such as the Start
  button, Start menu, the Desktop, and the taskbar. On clicking the Start
  button, the Start menu would pop up, from which you could launch programs. The
  taskbar held the Start button, running and pinned applications, and the system
  tray, which consisted of the time, volume and other icons.
</p>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Development History</summary>
  <p>
    The initial design and planning of Windows 95 can be traced back to around
    March 1992, just around the time before the release of Windows 3.1. At this
    time, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and Windows NT 3.1 were still in
    development. At this time, Microsoft's strategy was to have a next
    generation, high-end OS based on Windows NT, namely, Cairo, and a low-end,
    consumer-focused one as an evolution of Windows 3.1. The latter strategy was
    to develop a 32-bit underlying kernel and filesystem with 32-bit protected
    mode device drivers in Windows for Workgroups 3.11, however, although
    elements from the Cairo project eventually shipped in Windows NT 4.0 in late
    July 1996, without the object-based file system, which would later evolve
    into WinFS, to be used as the basis for the next version of Windows, code
    named "Chicago." Cairo would be Microsoft's next-generation operating system
    based on Windows NT, featuring a new user interface and an object-based file
    system, but it was not planned to be shipped before 1994. Cairo would never
    be shipped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simultaneously with Windows 3.1's release, IBM started shipping OS/2 2.0.
    Microsoft realized they required an updated version of Windows that could
    support 32-bit applications and preemptive multitasking, but could still run
    on low-end hardware (Windows NT did not). Initially, the "Chicago" team did
    not know how the product would be packaged. Initial thoughts were there
    might be two products, MS-DOS 7, which would just be the underlying OS, an
    evolution of the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 kernel, with a character mode
    OS on top, and a fully integrated graphical Windows OS. But soon into the
    project, the idea of MS-DOS 7 was abandoned and the decision was made to
    develop only an integrated graphical OS Windows "Chicago."
  </p>
  <p>
    Before Windows 95's official release, users in the United States and United
    Kingdom had an opportunity to participate in the Windows 95 Preview Program.
    For US$19.95/Â£19.95, users would receive several 3.5-inch floppy disks that
    would be used to install Windows 95 either as an upgrade from Windows 3.1 or
    as a fresh installation. Participants were also given a free preview of The
    Microsoft Network (MSN), the online service that Microsoft launched with
    Windows 95. During the preview period, Microsoft established various
    electronic distribution points for promotional and technical documentation
    on Chicago, including a detailed document for media reviewers describing the
    new system highlights. The preview versions expired in November 1995, after
    which the user would have to purchase their copy of the final version of
    Windows 95.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <p>
    Windows 95 included support for 255-character mixed-case long filenames and
    preemptively multitasked protected-mode 32-bit applications. 16-bit
    processes were still co-operatively multitasked.
  </p>
  <span>Plug and Play</span>
  <p>
    Windows 95 tried to automate device detection and configuration as much as
    possible, but could still fall back to manual settings if necessary. During
    the initial install process of Windows 95, it would attempt to automatically
    detect all devices installed in the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Windows 95 also introduced the Device Manager to indicate which devices were
    working optimally with correct drivers and configuration and to allow the
    user to override automatic Plug and Play-based driver installation with
    manual options or give a choice of several semi-automatic configurations to
    try to free up resources for devices that still needed manual configuration.
    Windows 95 also has built-in support for Advanced Power Management.
  </p>

  <span>Long file names</span>
  <p>
    32-bit File Access is necessary for the long file names feature introduced
    with Windows 95 through the use of the VFAT file system extension. It is
    available to both Windows programs and MS-DOS programs started from Windows
    (they have to be adapted slightly, since accessing long file names requires
    using larger pathname buffers and hence different system calls). Competing
    DOS-compatible operating systems released before Windows 95 cannot see these
    names. Using older versions of DOS utilities to manipulate files means that
    the long names are not visible and are lost if files are moved or renamed
    and by the copy (but not the original) if the file is copied. During a
    Windows 95 automatic upgrade of an older Windows 3.1 system, DOS and
    third-party disk utilities which can destroy long file names are identified
    and made unavailable. When Windows 95 is started in DOS mode, e.g. for
    running DOS programs, low-level access to disks is locked out. In case the
    need arises to depend on disk utilities that do not recognize long file
    names, such as the MS-DOS 6.x's defrag utility, a program called LFNBACK for
    backup and restoration of long file names is provided on the CD-ROM,
    specifically in its \ADMIN\APPTOOLS\LFNBACK directory.
  </p>

  <span>32-bit</span>
  <p>
    Windows 95 followed Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with its lack of support for
    older, 16-bit x86 processors, thus requiring an Intel 80386 (or compatible).
    While the OS kernel is 32-bit, much code (especially for the user interface)
    remained 16-bit for performance reasons as well as development time
    constraints.
  </p>
  <p>
    The introduction of 32-bit file access in Windows for Workgroups 3.11 meant
    that 16-bit real mode MS-DOS is not used for managing the files while
    Windows is running, and the earlier introduction of the 32-bit disk access
    means that the PC BIOS is often no longer used for managing hard disks. DOS
    can be used for running old-style drivers for compatibility, but Microsoft
    discourages using them, as this prevents proper multitasking and impairs
    system stability. Control Panel allows a user to see which MS-DOS components
    are used by the system; optimal performance is achieved when they are
    bypassed. The Windows kernel uses MS-DOS style real-mode drivers in Safe
    Mode, which exists to allow a user to fix problems relating to loading
    native, protected-mode drivers.
  </p>
  <span>Core improvements in OEM Service Releases</span>
  <p>
    OEM Service Releases of Windows 95 introduced support in Windows for several
    core new technologies that were not included in the original release of
    Windows 95. These include the Internet Explorer web browser, DriveSpace
    compression, OpenGL, DirectX, FAT32 file system support, UltraDMA mode for
    disk drives, Universal Serial Bus, IEEE 1394 (FireWire), and Accelerated
    Graphics Port.
  </p>

  <span>Accessibility features</span>
  <p>
    Windows 95 introduced computer accessibility features like Sticky keys,
    FilterKeys, ToggleKeys, Mouse keys. Microsoft Active Accessibility API was
    introduced as an add-on for Windows 95.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
  <p>
    Several Windows 95 editions have been released. Only the original release
    was sold as a shrink-wrapped product; later editions were provided only to
    computer OEMs for installation on new PCs. For this reason, these editions
    are known as OEM Service Releases (OSR).
  </p>

  <p>
    Together with the introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft released the
    Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 pack, which contained several optional
    components for high-end multimedia PCs, including Internet Explorer,
    DriveSpace and additional themes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first service pack was made available half a year after the original
    release and fixed several small bugs.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second service pack mainly introduced support for new hardware, most
    notably support for hard drives larger than 2 GB in the form of the FAT32
    file system. This release was never made available to end-users directly and
    was only sold through OEMs (OSR2) with the purchase of a new PC.
  </p>

  <p>
    A full third service pack was never released, but two smaller revisions to
    the second were released in the form of a USB Supplement (OSR2.1) and the
    Windows Desktop Update (OSR2.5). Both were made available as updated disc
    images shipped by OEMs, and the Windows Desktop Update was also released
    with the standalone Internet Explorer 4.0 release. OSR2.5 was notable for
    featuring several changes to the Windows Explorer, integrating it with
    Internet Explorer 4.0âthis version of Internet Explorer looks very similar
    to the one featured in Windows 98.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
  <p>
    Windows 95 introduced a redesigned shell based around a desktop metaphor;
    File shortcuts (also known as shell links) were introduced and the desktop
    was re-purposed to hold shortcuts to applications, files and folders,
    reminiscent of Mac OS.
  </p>
  <p>
    In Windows 3.1, the desktop was used to display icons of running
    applications. In Windows 95, the currently running applications were
    displayed as buttons on a taskbar across the bottom of the screen. The
    taskbar also contained a notification area used to display icons for
    background applications, a volume control and the current time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Start menu, invoked by clicking the "Start" button on the taskbar or by
    pressing the Windows key, was introduced as an additional means of launching
    applications or opening documents. While maintaining the program groups used
    by its predecessor Program Manager, it also displayed applications within
    cascading sub-menus.
  </p>
  <p>
    The previous File Manager program was replaced by Windows Explorer and the
    Explorer-based Control Panel and several other special folders were added
    such as My Computer, Dial-Up Networking, Recycle Bin, Network Neighborhood,
    My Documents, Recent documents, Fonts, Printers, and My Briefcase among
    others. AutoRun was introduced for CD drives.
  </p>
  <p>
    The user interface looked dramatically different from prior versions of
    Windows, but its design language did not have a special name like Metro,
    Aero or Fluent UI. Internally it was called "the new shell" and later simply
    "the shell". The subproject within Microsoft to develop the new shell was
    internally known as "Stimpy".
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1994, Microsoft designers Mark Malamud and Erik Gavriluk approached Brian
    Eno to compose music for the Windows 95 project. The result was the
    six-second start-up music-sound of the Windows 95 operating system, The
    Microsoft Sound and it was first released as a startup sound in May 1995 on
    Windows 95 May Test Release build 468.
  </p>
  <p>
    When released for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, Internet Explorer 4 came
    with an optional Windows Desktop Update, which modified the shell to provide
    several additional updates to Windows Explorer, including a Quick Launch
    toolbar, and new features integrated with Internet Explorer, such as Active
    Desktop (which allowed Internet content to be displayed directly on the
    desktop).
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the user interface elements introduced in Windows 95, such as the
    desktop, taskbar, Start menu and Windows Explorer file manager, remained
    fundamentally unchanged on future versions of Windows.
