<p style="font-size: 1.125rem; font-style: italic">
  This webpage does not have a section on editions as there is no information on
  Wikipedia about its editions. The four editions are the base edition (simply
  branded as Windows 8.1), Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise, and Windows
  RT 8.1 (designed for tablet PCs and other mobile devices with ARM processors.
</p>

<p>
  Windows 8.1 is a release of the Windows NT operating system developed by
  Microsoft. It was released to manufacturing on August 27, 2013, and broadly
  released for retail sale on October 17, 2013, about a year after the retail
  release of its predecessor, and succeeded by Windows 10 on July 29, 2015.
  Windows 8.1 was made available for download via MSDN and Technet and available
  as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows RT users via the
  Windows Store. A server version, Windows Server 2012 R2, was released on
  October 18, 2013.

<p>
  Windows 8.1 aimed to address complaints of Windows 8 users and reviewers on
  launch. Enhancements include an improved Start screen, additional snap views,
  additional bundled apps, tighter OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) integration,
  Internet Explorer 11 (IE11), a Bing-powered unified search system, restoration
  of a visible Start button on the taskbar, and the ability to restore the
  previous behavior of opening the user's desktop on login instead of the Start
  screen. Windows 8.1 also added support for then emerging technologies like
  high-resolution displays, 3D printing, Wi-Fi Direct, and Miracast streaming,
  as well as the ReFS file system.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="development">Development</h2>
<p>
  In February 2013, ZDNet writer Mary Jo Foley disclosed potential rumors about
  "Blue", the codename for a wave of planned updates across several Microsoft
  products and services, including Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, Outlook.com, and
  SkyDrive. In particular, the report detailed that Microsoft was planning to
  shift to a more "continuous" development model, which would see major
  revisions to its main software platforms released on a consistent yearly cycle
  to keep up with market demands. Lending credibility to the reports, Foley
  noted that a Microsoft staff member had listed experience with "Windows Blue"
  on his LinkedIn profile, and listed it as a separate operating system from 8.
</p>

<p>
  A post-RTM build of Windows 8, build 9364, was leaked in March 2013. The
  build, which was believed to be of "Windows Blue", revealed a number of
  enhancements across Windows 8's interface, including additional size options
  for tiles, expanded color options on the Start screen, the expansion of PC
  Settings to include more options that were previously exclusive to the desktop
  Control Panel, the ability for apps to snap to half of the screen, the ability
  to take screenshots from the Share charm, additional stock apps, increased
  SkyDrive integration (such as automatic device backups) and Internet Explorer
  11. Shortly afterward on March 26, 2013, corporate vice president of corporate
  communications Frank X. Shaw officially acknowledged the "Blue" project,
  stating that continuous development would be "the new normal" at Microsoft,
  and that "Our product groups are also taking a unified planning approach so
  people get what they want—all of their devices, apps and services working
  together wherever they are and for whatever they are doing."
</p>

<p>
  On April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the Windows 8.1 Update, which included
  all past updates plus new features, unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe
  Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full
  at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore noted that the update
  would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, so it can be
  installed on devices with as little as 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage.
  Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through
  Windows Update, and must be installed in order to receive any further patches.
</p>

<p>
  At the 2014 Build conference, during April, Microsoft's Terry Myerson unveiled
  further GUI changes for Windows 8.1, including the ability to run Metro-style
  apps inside desktop windows, and a revised Start menu, which creates a
  compromise between the Start menu design used by Windows 7 and the Start
  screen, by combining the application listing in the first column with a second
  that can be used to display app tiles, whereas Windows 8.0 used a screen
  hotspot ("hot corner"). Myerson stated that these changes would occur in a
  future update, but did not elaborate further. A distinction is the removal of
  the tooltip with the preview thumbnail of the Start screen.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="features">Features</h2>
<p>
  Many of the changes on Windows 8.1, particularly to the user interface, were
  made in response to criticisms from early adopters and other critics after the
  release of Windows 8.
</p>

<h2 class="level-two">Apps</h2>
<p>
  The suite of pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows
  8.1; PC Settings was expanded to include options that were previously
  exclusive to the desktop Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an
  improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app
  includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app
  integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools
  were added to the Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was
  completely removed). A number of additional stock apps were also added,
  including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder,
  Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through
  OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds
  a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However,
  it does not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or
  creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is enabled
  by default within Windows To Go environments. On January 31, 2020, Microsoft
  released the new Microsoft Edge web browser for Windows 8.1.
</p>

<h2 class="level-two">Online services and functionality</h2>
<p>
  Windows 8.1 adds tighter integration with several Microsoft-owned services.
  OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is integrated at the system level to sync user
  settings and files. Files are automatically downloaded in the background when
  they are accessed from the user's OneDrive folder, unless they are marked to
  be available offline. By default, only file metadata and thumbnails are stored
  locally, and reparse points are used to give the appearance of a normal
  directory structure to provide backwards compatibility. The OneDrive app was
  updated to include a local file manager. OneDrive use on Windows 8.1 requires
  that a user's Windows account be linked to a Microsoft account; the previous
  SkyDrive desktop client (which did not have this requirement) is not supported
  on Windows 8.1.
</p>

<p>
  A Bing-based unified search system was added; it can analyze a user's search
  habits to return results featuring relevant local and online content.
  Full-screen "hero" displays aggregate news articles, Wikipedia entries,
  multimedia, and other content related to a search query; for instance,
  searching for a music performer would return photos of the performer, a
  biography, and their available songs and albums on Xbox Music. The messaging
  app from Windows 8 has been replaced by Skype, which also allows users to
  accept calls directly from the lock screen. Windows 8.1 also includes Internet
  Explorer 11, which adds support for SPDY and WebGL, and expanded developer
  tools. The Metro-style variant of IE11 also adds tab syncing, the ability to
  open an unlimited number of tabs, and Reading List integration.
</p>

<p>
  Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in all
  bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.
</p>

<h2 class="level-two">Security and hardware compatibility</h2>
<p>
  On compatible hardware, Windows 8.1 also features a transparent "device
  encryption" system based on BitLocker. Encryption begins as soon as a user
  begins using the system; the recovery key is stored to either the user's
  Microsoft account or an Active Directory login, allowing it to be retrieved
  from any computer. While device encryption is offered on all editions of
  Windows 8.1 unlike BitLocker (which is exclusive to the Pro and Enterprise
  editions), device encryption requires that the device meet the Connected
  Standby specification and have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chip.
  Windows 8.1 also introduces improved fingerprint recognition APIs, which
  allows user login, User Account Control, Windows Store and Windows Store apps
  to use enrolled fingerprints as an authentication method. A new kiosk mode
  known as "Assigned Access" was also added, allowing a device to be configured
  to use a single app in a restricted environment. Additionally, Windows
  Defender includes an intrusion detection system which can scan network
  activity for signs of malware. Windows 8.1 also allows third-party VPN clients
  to automatically trigger connections.
</p>

<p>
  For enterprise device management, Windows 8.1 adds support for the Workplace
  Join feature of Windows Server 2012 R2, which allows users to enroll their own
  device into corporate networks with finer control over access to resources and
  security requirements. Windows 8.1 also supports the OMA Device Management
  specifications. Remote Data Control can be used to remotely wipe specific
  "corporate" data from Windows 8.1 devices.
</p>

<p>
  The 64-bit variants of Windows 8.1 no longer support processors which do not
  implement the double-width compare and exchange (CMPXCHG16B) CPU instruction
  (which the installer reports as a lack of support for "CompareExchange128"). A
  Microsoft spokesperson noted that the change primarily affects systems with
  older AMD 64-bit processors, and that "the number of affected processors are
  extremely small since this instruction has been supported for greater than 10
  years." It mostly concerns Socket 754 and Socket 939 Athlon 64 from 2004 and
  2005; the Socket AM2 CPUs should all have the instruction. Brad Chacos of PC
  World also reported a case in which Windows 8.1 rejected Intel Core 2 Quad
  Q9300 and a Q9550S despite their support for this instruction, because the
  associated Intel DP35DP motherboard did not. These changes do not affect the
  32-bit variants of Windows 8.1.
</p>

<h2 class="level-two">Hardware functionality</h2>
<p>
  Windows 8.1 adds support for 3D printing, pairing with printers using NFC
  tags, Wi-Fi Direct, Miracast media streaming, tethering, and NVMe. In response
  to the increasing pixel density in displays, Windows 8.1 can scale text and
  GUI elements up to 200% (whereas Windows 8 supported only 150%) and set
  scaling settings independently on each display in multi-monitor
  configurations.
</p>

<h2 class="level-two">Removed features</h2>
<p>
  Backup and Restore, the backup component of Windows that had been deprecated
  but was available in Windows 8 through a Control Panel applet called "Windows
  7 File Recovery", was removed.
</p>

<p>
  Windows 8.1 also removes the graphical user interface for the Windows System
  Assessment Tool, meaning that the Windows Experience Index is no longer
  displayed. The command line variant of the tool remains available on the
  system. Microsoft reportedly removed the graphical Windows Experience Index in
  order to promote the idea that all kinds of hardware run Windows 8 equally
  well.
</p>

<p>
  Windows 8.1 removed the ability of several Universal Windows Platform apps to
  act as "hubs" connecting similar services within a single interface:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Photos app lost the ability to view photos from Facebook, Flickr or
    SkyDrive (branded as OneDrive since February 2014). Instead, each service
    provider is expected to create its own app.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Messaging app, which was interoperable with Windows Live Messenger and
    Facebook Chat, was deprecated in favor of a Skype app that is not compatible
    with Facebook Chat;
  </li>
  <li>
    The Calendar app can only connect to Microsoft services such as Outlook.com
    and Microsoft Exchange, with support for Google Calendar removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Since October 2016, all future patches are cumulative as with Windows 10;
    individual patches can no longer be downloaded.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Users can only upgrade their previous version of Windows to Windows 8.1 using
  the revised installer introduced in Windows 8: they can no longer use
  setup.exe in the sources folder to upgrade their system.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>
  The Start screen received several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an
  extended "All Apps" view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new down
  arrow button or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for tiles, and
  colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options
  were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of
  which incorporate animated elements), and the ability for the Start screen to
  use the desktop background instead. Applications were no longer added to the
  Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have
  colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The
  app snapping system was also extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a
  single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the
  screen, and can also be used on any display in a multi-monitor configuration.
  Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for
  example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped
  to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for
  using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the
  ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera
  app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete
  mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select
  from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also
  automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and
  suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows
  Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate
  the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or
  right-clicking.
</p>

<p>
  To improve the usability of the desktop interface, a visible Start button was
  restored to the taskbar for opening the Start screen, and the Quick Links menu
  (accessed by right-clicking the Start button or pressing Win+X) now contains
  shutdown and sign-out options. Users can also modify certain user interface
  behaviors, such as disabling the upper hot corners for using the charms and
  recent apps list, going to the desktop instead of the Start screen on login or
  after closing all apps on a screen, automatically opening the "All Apps" view
  on the Start screen when opened, and prioritizing desktop programs on the
  "Category" sort mode on "All Apps". To assist users in learning the Windows 8
  user interface, an interactive tutorial was also offered, along with a new
  Help + Tips app for additional information. In contrast, Windows RT 8.1
  downplays the desktop interface further by not displaying the Desktop tile on
  its default Start screen at all (however, it can still be manually added to
  the Start screen).
</p>

<p>
  Windows manager Chaitanya Sareen stated that the restoration of the visible
  Start button was intended to be a "warm blanket" for users who had become
  confused by the removal of the button on 8; the Start button was originally
  removed to reflect Windows 8's treatment of the desktop as an "app" rather
  than the main interface.
</p>

<p>
  Further interface behavior changes are made on the April 2014 "Windows 8.1
  Update", which are oriented towards non-touch environments (such as desktop
  and laptop PCs) that use a keyboard and mouse, and improve integration between
  Windows Store apps and the desktop. When a mouse is in use, the Desktop is
  shown on startup by default, the Start screen uses context menus instead of a
  toolbar across the bottom of the screen for manipulating tiles, an autohiding
  title bar with minimize and close buttons is displayed within apps at the top
  of the screen, the taskbar can display and pin apps alongside desktop programs
  and be accessed from within apps, and visible search and power buttons are
  added to the Start screen. In non-touch environments, the default image viewer
  and media player programs were changed back to Windows Photo Viewer and
  Windows Media Player in lieu of the Xbox Video and Photos apps.
