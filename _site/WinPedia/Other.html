  This page lists other versions and lines of Windows that are/were not part of
  the main Windows line. These include Windows 10X, which was intended to be a
  major release of Windows like Windows 10 or 11, Windows CE, the earlier OS for
  phones, Windows Server, a version of Windows for servers, Windows Phone 8 and
  8.1, which was Microsoft's next attempt at a Windows for phones, Windows
  Mobile 10, the last of Microsoft's efforts in mobile phone operating systems,
  and MS-DOS, Microsoft's pre-Windows operating systems that led to the
  development of Windows.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one insertHere" id="windows-10x">Windows 10X</h2>
<p>
  Windows 10X was an edition of Windows 10, a major release of the Microsoft
  Windows series of operating systems. Announced by Microsoft on October 2,
  2019, it was initially developed as an operating system to support dual-screen
  devices, such as the unreleased Surface Neo. 10X was expected to be released
  in 2020, but Microsoft later announced that the project had been cancelled in
  May 2021. However, some features and design changes from 10X were integrated
  into the newer Windows 11. While the operating system was originally designed
  for dual-screen devices, Windows 10X shifted its target to single-screen
  devices in 2020 due to increasing demand for traditional computers from the
  COVID-19 pandemic.
</p>
<div class="info">
  <img src="/WinPedia/Images/Icons/Windows_10x-icon.webp" alt="Windows 10x" />
  <p>Date released: Scrapped, never released</p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>

<h2 class="level-one" id="windows-ce">Windows CE</h2>
<p>
  Windows CE, later known as Windows Embedded CE and Windows Embedded Compact,
  is a discontinued operating system developed by Microsoft for mobile and
  embedded devices. It was part of the Windows Embedded family and served as the
  software foundation of several products including the Handheld PC, Pocket PC,
  Auto PC, Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7 and others.
</p>

<div class="info">
  <img src="/WinPedia/Images/Icons/Windows_CE-icon.webp" alt="Windows CE logo (?version)" />
  <p>
    Date released: November 16, 1996 (initial release,
    <a href="#otherreleases">click to see releases of other versions</a>)
  </p>
  <p>Codenames: <a href="#otherreleases">Click to see codenames</a></p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>

<p>
  Unlike Windows Embedded Standard, Windows For Embedded Systems, Windows
  Embedded Industry and Windows IoT, which are based on Windows NT, Windows CE
  uses a different hybrid kernel. Microsoft licensed it to original equipment
  manufacturers (OEMs), who could modify and create their own user interfaces
  and experiences, with Windows Embedded Compact providing the technical
  foundation to do so.
</p>

<p>
  Earlier versions of Windows CE worked on MIPS and SHx architectures, but in
  version 7.0 released in 2011—when the product was also renamed to Embedded
  Compact-support for these were dropped but remained for MIPS II architecture.
  The final version, Windows Embedded Compact 2013 (version 8.0), released in
  2013, only supports x86 and ARM processors with board support package (BSP)
  directly. It had mainstream support until October 9, 2018, and extended
  support ended on October 10, 2023; however, license sales for OEMs will
  continue until 2028.
</p>

<p id="otherreleases">
  Windows CE had multiple releases. Their release dates and codenames are
  mentioned below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows CE 1.0 (Codename Pegasus and Alder)- November 16, 1996</li>
  <li>Windows CE 2.0 (Codename Jupiter and Birch)- September 29, 1997</li>
  <li>Windows CE 3.0 (Codename Gryphon and Cedar)- March 11, 1998</li>
  <li>Windows CE 4.0 (Codename Talisker)- January 7, 2002</li>
  <li>Windows CE 5.0 (Codename Macallan)- July 9, 2004</li>
  <li>Windows Embedded CE 6.0 (Codename Yamazaki)- November 1, 2006</li>
  <li>Windows Embedded Compact 7.0 (Codename Chelan)- March 1, 2011</li>
  <li>
    Windows Embedded Compact 2013 (version 8.0) (Codename Obregon)- June 13,
    2013
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="level-one" id="windows-server">Windows Server</h2>
<p>
  Windows Server (formerly Windows NT Server) is a brand name for
  server-oriented releases of the Windows NT operating system (OS) that have
  been developed by Microsoft since 1993. The first release under this brand
  name is Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server, an edition of Windows NT 3.1. With the
  release of Windows Server 2003, Microsoft started releasing new versions under
  the name Windows Server. The latest release of Windows NT under the Windows
  Server brand is Windows Server 2025. The User Interface of Windows Server
  operating systems has changed with the mainstream Windows versions, with
  little difference in the GUI.
</p>
<div class="info">
  <img src="/WinPedia/Images/Icons/Windows_Server-icon.webp" alt="Windows Server 2012, 2020?" />
  <p>First Release: July 27, 1993</p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>
<p>
  Microsoft's history of developing operating systems for servers goes back to
  Windows NT 3.1 Advanced Server. Windows 2000 Server is the first release to
  include Active Directory, DNS Server, DHCP Server, and Group Policy.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="windows-phone">Windows Phone 8 and 8.1</h2>
<p>
  Windows Phone 8 is the second generation of the Windows Phone mobile operating
  system from Microsoft. It was released on October 29, 2012, and, like its
  predecessor, it features a flat user interface based on the Metro design
  language. Windows Phone 8.1 is the third generation of Microsoft Mobile's
  Windows Phone mobile operating system, succeeding Windows Phone 8. Windows
  Phone 8.1 was rolled out at Microsoft's Build Conference in San Francisco,
  California on April 2, 2014, and was released in final form to Windows Phone
  developers on April 14, 2014, reaching general availability on August 4, 2014.
  All Windows Phones running Windows Phone 8 can be upgraded to Windows Phone
  8.1, with release dependent on carrier rollout dates.
</p>

<div class="info">
  <img src="/WinPedia/Images/Icons/Windows_Phone_8n8.1-icon.webp" alt="Windows Phone 8 and 8.1" />
  <p>
    Date released: October 29, 2012 (Windows Phone 8), August 4, 2014 (Windows
    Phone 8.1)
  </p>
  <p>
    Last releases: Update 3 (Build 8.0.10532.166) on April 14, 2014 (Windows
    Phone 8), Update 2 (8.10.15148.160) on June 2, 2015 (Windows Phone 8.1)
  </p>
  <p>Preceded by: Windows Phone 7 (2010)</p>
  <p>Succeeded by: Windows 10 Mobile (2015)</p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>

<p>
  Windows Phone 8 replaces the Windows CE-based architecture used in Windows
  Phone 7 with the Windows NT kernel found in Windows 8. Because of this,
  Windows Phone 7 devices cannot run or update to Windows Phone 8, and new
  applications compiled specifically for Windows Phone 8 are not made available
  for Windows Phone 7 devices. Developers can make their apps available on both
  Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 devices by targeting both platforms via
  the proper SDKs in Visual Studio. Windows Phone 8.1 is also the last version
  that uses the Windows Phone brand name as it was succeeded by Windows 10
  Mobile. Some Windows Phone 8.1 devices are capable of being upgraded to
  Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft delayed the upgrade and reduced the supported
  device list from their initial promise. Support has ended for Windows Phone 8
  on January 12, 2016 and Windows Phone 8.1 on July 11, 2017.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="windows-mobile">Windows Mobile 10</h2>
<p>
  Windows 10 Mobile is a discontinued mobile operating system developed by
  Microsoft Mobile. It is the successor to Windows Phone 8.1, but was marketed
  by Microsoft as being an edition of its PC operating system Windows 10.
</p>
<div class="info">
  <img src="/WinPedia/Images/Icons/Windows_Mobile_10-icon.webp" alt="Windows Mobile 10" />
  <p>
    Date released: November 20, 2015 (Release To Manufacturing), March 17, 2016
    (General Availability)
  </p>
  <p>Preceded by: Windows Phone 8.1 (2014), Windows RT (2012)</p>
  <p>
    Succeeded by: Microsoft Launcher on Android 10 via the Surface Duo (2020)
  </p>
  <p>Developed by: Microsoft Corporation</p>
</div>
<p>
  Windows 10 Mobile aimed to provide greater consistency with its counterpart
  for PCs, including more extensive synchronization of content, Universal
  Windows Platform apps, as well as the capability, on supported hardware, to
  connect devices to an external display and use a desktop interface with mouse
  and keyboard input support (reminiscent of Windows on PCs). Microsoft built
  tools for developers to port iOS Objective-C apps with minimal modifications.
  Windows Phone 8.1 smartphones are eligible for upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile,
  pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support. Some features vary depending on
  hardware compatibility.
</p>

<p>
  Windows 10 Mobile was designed for use on smartphones and phablets running on
  32-bit ARM processor architectures. Microsoft also intended for the platform
  to be used on ARM tablets with screens 9 inches or smaller in size, but such
  devices were rarely commercially released. Windows 10 Mobile entered public
  beta for selected Lumia smartphones on February 12, 2015. The first Lumia
  smartphones powered by Windows 10 Mobile were released on November 20, 2015,
  while eligible Windows Phone devices began receiving updates to Windows 10
  Mobile on March 17, 2016, pursuant to manufacturer and carrier support.
</p>

<p>
  The platform never achieved any significant degree of popularity or market
  share in comparison to Android or iOS. By 2017, Microsoft had already begun to
  downplay Windows 10 Mobile, having discontinued active development (beyond
  maintenance releases) due to a lack of user and developer interest in the
  platform, and focused on serving incumbent mobile operating systems as part of
  its software and services strategy. Support for Windows 10 Mobile ended on
  January 14, 2020. As of November 2021, Windows 10 Mobile had approximately a
  0.01% share of the mobile operating system market.

<h2 class="level-one" id="ms-dos">MS-DOS</h2>
<p>
  MS-DOS (/ˌɛmˌɛsˈdɒs/ em-es-DOSS; acronym for Microsoft Disk Operating System,
  also known as Microsoft DOS) is an operating system for x86-based personal
  computers mostly developed by Microsoft. Collectively, MS-DOS, its rebranding
  as IBM PC DOS, and a few operating systems attempting to be compatible with
  MS-DOS, are sometimes referred to as "DOS" (which is also the generic acronym
  for disk operating system). MS-DOS was the main operating system for IBM PC
  compatibles during the 1980s, from which point it was gradually superseded by
  operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various
  generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system.
</p>
<div class="info">
  <img src="/WinPedia/Images/Icons/MSDOS-icon.webp" alt="MS-DOS" />
  <p>Initial release: August 12, 1981</p>
  <p>Final release: 8.0 (Windows ME) on September 14, 2000</p>
  <p>Preceded by: 86-DOS</p>
  <p>Succeeded by: Windows NT (from Windows XP onwards)(2001)</p>
  <p>
    Source model: Closed source (open source for versions 1.25, 2.11 and 4.00)

</div>
<p>
  IBM licensed and re-released it in 1981 as PC DOS 1.0 for use in its PCs.
  Although MS-DOS and PC DOS were initially developed in parallel by Microsoft
  and IBM, the two products diverged after twelve years, in 1993, with
  recognizable differences in compatibility, syntax and capabilities. Beginning
  in 1988 with DR-DOS, several competing products were released for the x86
  platform.
</p>
<p>
  Initially, MS-DOS was targeted at Intel 8086 processors running on computer
  hardware using floppy disks to store and access not only the operating system,
  but application software and user data as well. Progressive version releases
  delivered support for other mass storage media in ever greater sizes and
  formats, along with added feature support for newer processors and rapidly
  evolving computer architectures. Ultimately, it was the key product in
  Microsoft's development from a programming language company to a diverse
  software development firm, providing the company with essential revenue and
  marketing resources. It was also the underlying basic operating system on
  which early versions of Windows ran as a GUI. MS-DOS went through eight
  versions, until development ceased in 2000; version 6.22 from 1994 was the
  final standalone version, with versions 7 and 8 serving mostly in the
  background for loading Windows 9x.
