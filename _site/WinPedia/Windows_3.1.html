  Windows 3.1 is a major release of Microsoft Windows. It was released to
  manufacturing on April 6, 1992, as a successor to Windows 3.0. Like its
  predecessors, the Windows 3.1 series run as a shell on top of MS-DOS; it was
  the last Windows 16-bit operating environment as all future versions of
  Windows had moved to 32-bit.
</p>
<p>
  The TrueType font system was introduced in Windows 3.1 as a competitor to
  Adobe Type Manager. Its multimedia was also expanded, and screensavers were
  introduced, alongside new software such as Windows Media Player and Sound
  Recorder. File Manager and Control Panel received tweaks, and Windows 3.1 saw
  the introduction of the Windows Registry and add-ons. It could even utilize
  more memory than its predecessors.

</div>

<p>
  Microsoft also released special versions of Windows 3.1 throughout 1992 and
  1993; in Europe and Japan, Windows 3.1 was introduced with more language
  support. In November 1993, Windows 3.11 was released as a minor update, while
  Windows 3.2 was released as a Simplified Chinese version of Windows 3.1.
  Microsoft also introduced Windows for Workgroups, the first version of Windows
  to allow integrated networking. Mostly oriented towards businesses, it
  received network improvements and it allowed users to share files, use print
  servers, and chat online, while it also introduced peer-to-peer networking.
</p>

<p>
  The series is considered to be an improvement on its predecessors. It was
  praised for its reinvigoration of the user interface and technical design.
  Windows 3.1 sold over three million copies during the first three months of
  its release, although its counterpart Windows for Workgroups was noted as a
  "business disappointment" due to its small amount of sold copies. It was
  succeeded by Windows 95, and Microsoft ended the support for Windows 3.1
  series on December 31, 2001, except for the embedded version, which was
  retired in 2008.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="development">Development</h2>
<p>
  Windows 3.0, the predecessor of 3.1, was released in 1990, and is considered
  to be the first version of Windows to receive critical acclaim. Windows 3.0
  received around 10 million sales before the release of Windows 3.1 on April 6,
  1992. Microsoft began a television advertising campaign for the first time on
  March 1, 1992. The advertisements, developed by Ogilvy & Mather, were designed
  to introduce a broader audience to Windows.
</p>

<p>
  Windows 3.1 was codenamed Janus. Like its predecessors, the operating
  environment runs as a shell on top of MS-DOS, although it does not include the
  MS-DOS Executive shell. After the introduction of Windows 1.0, Microsoft had
  worked on gaining support from companies to expand its operating environment
  on different types of PCs. Tandy Corporation was open to shipping Tandy
  Sensation PCs with the Windows 3.1 operating environment. IBM and its PCs were
  also provided with Windows 3.1.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="features">Features</h2>
<p>
  Further enhancements were introduced in Windows 3.1. The TrueType font system
  was introduced to provide scalable fonts to Windows applications, without
  having to resort on using third-party technology such as Adobe Type Manager
  (ATM). Windows 3.1 introduced Arial, Courier New, and Times New Roman fonts,
  in regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic versions, which could be scaled to
  any size and rotated, depending on the application.
</p>
<p>
  To improve user interaction, Microsoft initiated warning and event sounds, and
  introduced computer command shortcuts for copy, cut, and paste. Windows 3.1 is
  also noted for its improvement of multimedia; screensavers, Windows Media
  Player, and Sound Recorder were introduced into the operating environment.
  These features were already present on the Windows 3.0 with Multimedia
  Extensions version, although they were only available to users with newly
  bought PCs. The Media Player could play MIDI music files and AVI video files,
  while the Sound Recorder could play, record, and edit sound files that were
  affiliated with the WAV format.  Minesweeper was officially introduced in
  Windows 3.1 as a replacement for Reversi, alongside Solitaire. MS-DOS programs
  were previously not able to be controlled with a mouse; this ended up being
  introduced in Windows 3.1. Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) was added to
  allow drag-and-drop embedding of images and formatted text between Windows
  programs. SVGA color support was also introduced in this version.
</p>
<p>
  File Manager had also received tweaks; split view-mode was introduced, users
  were now able to browse files without having to open separate windows, while
  files were able to be dragged and dropped to other locations on the system. An
  option for quick formatting was introduced to format floppy disks and copy its
  files without having to quit Windows. File Manager is an MDI application that
  is used for moving, deleting, and managing files on the system. Microsoft also
  built Microsoft Bob, a utility that would act as a search assistant, on
  Windows 3.1, only for it to be released on Windows 95 in 1995. The
  introduction of Windows Registry, a centralized database that could store
  configuration information and settings for various operating systems
  components and applications, also occurred in this version. The Control Panel
  also received changes; its items were now hard-coded, and additional items
  could be added by placing additional .cpl files. Similarly, the Calendar uses
  the .cal extension. Printer management tasks were moved over to Control Panel
  and Print Manager. Several printer drivers were improved in Windows 3.1,
  making the Print Manager more efficient to use.  Windows 3.1 also includes
  troubleshooting and diagnostic tools such as the Dr. Watson utility which
  saves information about application errors, and Microsoft Diagnostics.
</p>
<p>
  Windows 3.1 also includes add-ons; Video for Windows was introduced in
  November 1992 as a reaction to Apple's QuickTime technology. At the price of
  $200, the software included editing and encoding programs. It was later built
  into Windows 95. Microsoft also published Windows for Pen Computing, a pen
  computing interface which was created in response to PenPoint OS by GO
  Corporation. The operating environment was also given limited compatibility
  with the then-new 32-bit Windows API, by introducing Win32s, an enabling
  technology. Microsoft also provided WinG, an application program interface, to
  entice developers to move from DOS to Windows. It also provided a
  device-independent interface to graphics and printer hardware, and allowed
  programs to have both read and write capabilities to the WinGDC.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike all previous versions, Windows 3.1 could not run in real mode and it
  insisted on the use of 80286 processors or above. Because of this, the maximum
  memory available was increased. While Windows 3.0 was limited to 16 MB maximum
  memory, Windows 3.1 could access a theoretical 4 GB in the 386 enhanced mode.
  The actual practical ceiling is 256 MB. Like its predecessors, it runs as a
  16-bit system; Windows 3.1 is also the last Windows to run in 16-bit mode. It
  is also the first Windows to be distributed on a CD-ROM. The setup interface
  was simplified; express mode was introduced to automatically set up Windows.
  Windows 3.1 also includes an online tutorial applet for users regarding the
  use of the Windows 3.1 user interface. In addition it supported the Advanced
  Power Management standard.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="editions">Editions</h2>
<br />
<span class="bolden">Windows 3.1 for Central and Eastern Europe</span>
<p>
  A special version named "Windows 3.1 for Central and Eastern Europe"
  introduced eleven languages to Windows 3.1. It also provided support for the
  Cyrillic script. To use Czech, Hungarian, and Polish terminologies this
  version was required, while to use Russian terminologies a Russian version of
  Windows 3.1 was needed. Similarly, Microsoft also released Windows 3.1J with
  support for Japanese, which shipped 1.46 million copies in its first year on
  the market (1993) in Japan.
</p>

<span class="bolden">Modular Windows</span>
<p>
  Modular Windows was built for real-time consumer electronics, and was designed
  to be controlled via television. It was a special version of Windows 3.1,
  which was designed to run on Tandy Video Information System; it allowed users
  to run multimedia software without having to buy a personal computer. It also
  contained a software development kit (SDK) for programmers to write
  applications that would run on devices that have Modular Windows. The SDK was
  sold for $99. Modular Windows was discontinued in 1994.
</p>

<span class="bolden">Windows 3.11</span>
<p>
  Released on November 8, 1993, Windows 3.11 was introduced with fixes for
  network problems which were present on Windows 3.1 As a minor update, new
  features were not present in this version. It also did not run on IBM's OS/2
  for Windows. Windows 3.11 allowed users to connect to each other as peers to
  share the resources of their computers. Microsoft replaced all retail and OEM
  versions of Windows 3.1 with Windows 3.11 and provided a free upgrade to
  anyone who owned Windows 3.1.
</p>

<span class="bolden">Windows 3.2</span>
<p>
  An updated Simplified Chinese version of Windows 3.1 was released in November
  1993, as Windows 3.2. The update was limited to this language version, as it
  only fixed issues related to the complex input system for the Simplified
  Chinese language. A font editor is present in Windows 3.2; it is used to add
  new Chinese characters to the already-existing fonts.
</p>

<span class="bolden">Windows for Workgroups</span>
<p>
  Windows for Workgroups served as an update to Windows 3.1, and it was the
  first version of Windows that was suitable for integrated networking.
  Initially developed as an add-on for Windows 3.0, it was later released in
  1992. It introduced drivers and protocols for peer-to-peer networking. Windows
  for Workgroups was mostly oriented towards businesses. The two vesion released
  are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 2.125vh; color: white"
      >Windows for Workgroups 3.11</span
    >
    <p>
      The first version of Windows for Workgroups, 3.1, was released on October
      27, 1992. Codenamed Winball and Sparta, it allows users to share files,
      use print servers, and chat online; files could be accessed from other
      machines that run either Windows or DOS. The Microsoft Hearts card game
      was also added, while Object Linking and Embedding, which was implemented
      in Windows 3.1, was also included in the Windows for Workgroups version.
      The Workgroups version also introduced the Microsoft Mail program, which
      allowed users to receive and send emails, and Microsoft Schedule+, a time
      management app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Windows for Workgroups could also be accessed from an OS/2 client that
      uses the Server Message Block (SMB), a protocol used for sharing files and
      printers over local networks. It introduced support for the NetBEUI
      protocol. The price sat at $69 for Windows 3.1 users.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 2.125vh; color: white"
      >Windows for Workgroups 3.11</span
    >
    <p>
      The other version, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, was released on November
      8, 1993. It was codenamed Snowball, and it introduced support for 32-bit
      file access, drive sharing, and group calendaring. It also has built-in
      fax capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It received network improvements; a Winsock package was released for
      Windows for Workgroups, although it was later replaced by a 32-bit stack
      add-on package (codenamed Wolverine) that provided TCP/IP support in
      Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Its connectivity with NetWare networks was
      increased, while it also introduced support for Open Data-Link Interface
      cards and Internetwork Packet Exchange drivers. Remote access service was
      introduced as a product for users to remotely access Windows NT and its
      Advanced Server networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It runs in 80386 enhanced mode, and it supports the use of network
      redirectors. It was sold in two versions; the complete package cost $219
      while the "Workgroup Add-on for Windows" cost $69.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="level-one" id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Windows 3.1 changed some icons, of which the most notable change is the
  addition of color to icons. Some icons changed include the ones for File
  Manager, Control Panel, Paint, Notepad and Calculator.<!--  Generated by Gemini -->
</p>
<p>
  Windows 3.1 introduced TrueType font support, therefore making fonts clearer
  at any size. They were vector fonts, which meant that they used mathematical
  equations to define the size of every letter, so they could be scaled to any
  size without losing quality. Before TrueType fonts, bitmap fonts were used
  which were made on a grid of pixels, causing them to become jagged and / or
  pixelated on increasing their size.
</p>
<p>
  Many features from the Mutimedia Extensions pack for Windows 3.0 were
  integrated into Windows 3.1. One of those programs was Media Player, which
  could play WAV and MIDI audio files and AVI video files. Sound Recorder was
  also added, allowing users to record and edit audio files.
