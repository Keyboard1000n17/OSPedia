  by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the direct successor to
  Windows NT 3.51, and was released to manufacturing on July 31, 1996, and then
  to retail in August 24, 1996, with the Server versions released to retail in
  September 1996.

  designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor
  <abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</abbr>. It was Microsoft's primary
  business-oriented operating system until the release of Windows 2000. Three
  editions were sold - Workstation, Server and Embedded editions, and each
  edition featured a Graphical User Interface UI similar to that of Windows 95.
  Windows NT 4.0 was the last public release of Microsoft Windows for the Alpha,
  MIPS, and PowerPC architectures.

  <p>
    Windows NT 4.0 received six service packs during its lifecycle, as well as
    numerous service rollup packages and option packs. Only the first service
    pack was made available for the MIPS architecture, Service Pack 2 was the
    final release for the PowerPC architecture, and Service Pack 6 was the final
    release for the Alpha architecture. Service Pack 6a (SP6a) is the last
    released service pack for Windows NT 4.0.
  </p>

  <p>
    Service Pack 7 was planned at one stage in early 2001, but this became the
    Post SP6a Security Rollup and not a full service pack, released on July 26,
    2001, 16 months following the release of Windows 2000 and nearly three
    months prior to the release of Windows XP.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to bug fixes, the service packs also added a multitude of new
    features such as Ultra DMA mode for disk drives along with bus mastering,
    newer versions of Internet Information Services, user accounts and user
    profile improvements, smart card support, improved symmetric multiprocessing
    (SMP) scalability, clustering capabilities, MMX / 3DNow! / SSE / SSE2
    support, AGP support, COM support improvements, Event Log service, MS-CHAPv2
    and NTLMv2, SMB packet signing, Syskey, boot improvements, WINS
    improvements, Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), PPTP, DCOM/HTTP
    tunneling improvements, IGMPv2, WMI, Active Accessibility and NTFS 3.0
    support among others.

  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <p>
    Although the chief enhancement has been the addition of the Windows 95
    shell, there are several major performance, scalability and feature
    improvements to the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC.
    Windows NT 4.0 also introduced the concept of system policies and the System
    Policy Editor.
  </p>
  <p>Other important features were:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crypto API</li>
    <li>
      Telephony API 2.0 with limited Unimodem support, which was the first
      release of TAPI on Windows NT
    </li>
    <li>DCOM and new OLE features</li>
    <li>Microsoft Transaction Server for network applications</li>
    <li>
      Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ), which improved interprocess
      communication
    </li>
    <li>Winsock 2 and the TCP/IP stack improvements</li>
    <li>File system defragmentation support</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The server editions of Windows NT 4.0 include Internet Information Services
    2.0, Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, NetShow Services, Remote Access Service (which
    includes a PPTP server for VPN functionality) and Multi-Protocol Routing
    service. There are new administrative wizards and a lite version of the
    Network Monitor utility shipped with System Management Server. The
    Enterprise edition introduced Microsoft Cluster Server.
  </p>
  <p>
    One significant difference from previous versions of Windows NT is that the
    Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into kernel mode rather than being
    in user mode in the CSRSS process. This eliminated a process-to-process
    context switch in calling GDI functions, resulting in a significant
    performance improvement over Windows NT 3.51, particularly in the graphical
    user interface. This, however, also mandated that graphics and printer
    drivers had to run in kernel mode as well, resulting in potential stability
    issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    Windows NT 4.0 was the first release of Microsoft Windows to include DirectX
    as standardâ€”version 2 shipped with the initial release of Windows NT 4.0,
    and version 3 was included with the release of Service Pack 3 in mid-1997.
    However advanced hardware accelerated Direct3D and DirectSound multimedia
    features were never available on Windows NT 4.0. Later versions of DirectX
    were not released for Windows NT 4.0. However, OpenGL was supported; it was
    used by Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.
  </p>
  <p>
    In early releases of 4.0, numerous stability issues did occur as graphics
    and printer vendors had to change their drivers to be compatible with the
    kernel mode interfaces exported by GDI. The change to move the GDI to run in
    the same process context as its caller was prompted by complaints from NT
    Workstation users about real-time graphics performance, but this change put
    a considerable onus on hardware manufacturers to update device drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Windows NT 4.0 also included a new Windows Task Manager utility. Previous
    versions of Windows NT included the Task List utility, but it only shows
    applications currently on the desktop. To monitor CPU and memory usage,
    users were forced to use Performance Monitor. The task manager offers a more
    convenient way of getting a snapshot of all the processes running on the
    system at any given time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Internet Explorer 2 was bundled with Windows NT 4. The installation of
    Internet Explorer 4 on Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later) gave Windows
    NT 4.0 Active Desktop and browser integration into Windows Explorer, known
    as the Windows Desktop Update.
  </p>
  <p>
    Windows NT 4.0 upgraded NTVDM's x86 emulation in the RISC versions from 286
    to 486. Sysprep was introduced as a deployment tool with Windows NT 4.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    x86 versions of Windows NT 4.0 require the BIOS firmware. RISC versions of
    Windows NT 4.0 require the ARC firmware.
  </p>

  <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
  <p>There are numerous different editions of Windows NT 4.0. They include:</p>
  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: 800">Client</span><br />
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: 600">Windows NT 4.0 Workstation</span> was

  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: 600">Windows NT 4.0 Server</span>, released in
      1996, was designed for small-scale business server systems.

    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: 600"
        >Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition</span
      >, released in 1997, is the precursor to the Enterprise line of the
      Windows server family (Advanced Server in Windows 2000). Enterprise Server
      was designed for high-demand, high-traffic networks. Windows NT 4.0
      Server, Enterprise Edition includes Service Pack 3. The Enterprise Edition
      saw the introduction of the /3GB boot flag, which changed the default
      virtual address space mapping from 2 GB kernel and 2 GB user space to 1 GB
      kernel and 3 GB userland. This version also sees the first introduction of
      cluster service.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: 600"
        >Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition</span
      >, (known as Windows-based Terminal Server 4.0 and Windows Terminal Server
      4.0 in beta builds) released on June 16, 1998, allows the users to log on
      remotely. The same functionality was called Terminal Services in Windows
      2000 and later server releases, and also powers the Remote Desktop feature
      that first appeared in Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Windows
      NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition, like Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise
      Edition, includes Service Pack 3.

  <span style="font-size: 22px; font-weight: 800">Embedded</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: 600">Windows NT 4.0 Embedded</span>
      (abbreviated NTe) is an edition of Windows NT 4.0 that was aimed at
      computer-powered major appliances, vending machines, ATMs and other
      devices that cannot be considered general-purpose computers per se. It is
      the same system as the standard Windows NT 4.0, but it comes packaged in a
      database of components and dependencies, from which a developer can choose
      individual components to build customized setup CDs and hard disk boot
      images. Windows NT 4.0 Embedded includes Service Pack 5. It was succeeded
      by Windows XP Embedded. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows NT
      4.0 Embedded on June 30, 2003, and received three years of extended
      support, which means that support for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded ended on the
      same day support for Windows 98 and Windows Me ended on July 11, 2006.

  <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
  <p>
    Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 was the first version of the NT family to feature
    a GUI similar to that of Windows 95. Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user
    interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT family, including the Windows
    shell, File Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer at the time), and the use
    of "My" nomenclature for shell folders (e.g. My Computer). It also includes
    most components introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was
    known as the Shell Update Release (SUR). While many administrative tools,
    notably User Manager for Domains, Server Manager and Domain Name Service
    Manager still used the old graphical user interfaces, the Start menu in
    Windows NT 4.0 separated the per-user shortcuts and folders from the shared
    shortcuts and folders by a separator line. One significant difference from
    previous versions of Windows NT is that the Graphics Device Interface (GDI)
    is moved into kernel mode rather than being in user mode in the
    <abbr title="Client Server Runtime SubSystem">CSRSS process</abbr>. This
    eliminated a process-to-process context switch in calling GDI function,
    which results in a significant performance improvement over Windows NT 3.51,
    particularly in the graphical user interface. This, however, also mandated
    that graphics and printer drivers had to run in kernel mode as well,
    resulting in potential stability issues.
