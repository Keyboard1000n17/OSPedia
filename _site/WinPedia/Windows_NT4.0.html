<p>
  Windows NT 4.0 is a major release of the Windows NT operating system developed
  by Microsoft and oriented towards businesses. It is the direct successor to
  Windows NT 3.51, and was released to manufacturing on July 31, 1996, and then
  to retail in August 24, 1996, with the Server versions released to retail in
  September 1996.

<p>
  Windows NT 4.0 is a preemptively multitasked, 32-bit operating system that is
  designed to work with either uniprocessor or symmetric multi-processor
  <abbr title="Personal Computers">PCs</abbr>. It was Microsoft's primary
  business-oriented operating system until the release of Windows 2000. Three
  editions were sold - Workstation, Server and Embedded editions, and each
  edition featured a Graphical User Interface UI similar to that of Windows 95.
  Windows NT 4.0 was the last public release of Microsoft Windows for the Alpha,
  MIPS, and PowerPC architectures.
</p>

<p id="support">
  Mainstream support for Windows NT 4.0 Workstation ended on June 30, 2002 and
  extended support ended on June 30, 2004; being succeeded by Windows 2000
  Professional. <br />
  Windows NT 4.0 Server mainstream support ended on December 31, 2002 and
  extended support ended on December 31, 2004; which was succeeded by the
  Windows 2000 Server family.<br />

<p>
  Windows NT 4.0 received six service packs during its lifecycle, as well as
  numerous service rollup packages and option packs. Only the first service pack
  was made available for the MIPS architecture, Service Pack 2 was the final
  release for the PowerPC architecture, and Service Pack 6 was the final release
  for the Alpha architecture. Service Pack 6a (SP6a) is the last released
  service pack for Windows NT 4.0.
</p>

<p>
  Service Pack 7 was planned at one stage in early 2001, but this became the
  Post SP6a Security Rollup and not a full service pack, released on July 26,
  2001, 16 months following the release of Windows 2000 and nearly three months
  prior to the release of Windows XP.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to bug fixes, the service packs also added a multitude of new
  features such as Ultra DMA mode for disk drives along with bus mastering,
  newer versions of Internet Information Services, user accounts and user
  profile improvements, smart card support, improved symmetric multiprocessing
  (SMP) scalability, clustering capabilities, MMX / 3DNow! / SSE / SSE2 support,
  AGP support, COM support improvements, Event Log service, MS-CHAPv2 and
  NTLMv2, SMB packet signing, Syskey, boot improvements, WINS improvements,
  Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), PPTP, DCOM/HTTP tunneling
  improvements, IGMPv2, WMI, Active Accessibility and NTFS 3.0 support among
  others.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="features">Features</h2>
<p>
  Although the chief enhancement has been the addition of the Windows 95 shell,
  there are several major performance, scalability and feature improvements to
  the core architecture, kernel, USER32, COM and MSRPC. Windows NT 4.0 also
  introduced the concept of system policies and the System Policy Editor.
</p>
<p>Other important features were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Crypto API</li>
  <li>
    Telephony API 2.0 with limited Unimodem support, which was the first release
    of TAPI on Windows NT
  </li>
  <li>DCOM and new OLE features</li>
  <li>Microsoft Transaction Server for network applications</li>
  <li>
    Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ), which improved interprocess communication
  </li>
  <li>Winsock 2 and the TCP/IP stack improvements</li>
  <li>File system defragmentation support</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The server editions of Windows NT 4.0 include Internet Information Services
  2.0, Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, NetShow Services, Remote Access Service (which
  includes a PPTP server for VPN functionality) and Multi-Protocol Routing
  service. There are new administrative wizards and a lite version of the
  Network Monitor utility shipped with System Management Server. The Enterprise
  edition introduced Microsoft Cluster Server.
</p>
<p>
  One significant difference from previous versions of Windows NT is that the
  Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into kernel mode rather than being in
  user mode in the CSRSS process. This eliminated a process-to-process context
  switch in calling GDI functions, resulting in a significant performance
  improvement over Windows NT 3.51, particularly in the graphical user
  interface. This, however, also mandated that graphics and printer drivers had
  to run in kernel mode as well, resulting in potential stability issues.
</p>
<p>
  Windows NT 4.0 was the first release of Microsoft Windows to include DirectX
  as standard—version 2 shipped with the initial release of Windows NT 4.0, and
  version 3 was included with the release of Service Pack 3 in mid-1997. However
  advanced hardware accelerated Direct3D and DirectSound multimedia features
  were never available on Windows NT 4.0. Later versions of DirectX were not
  released for Windows NT 4.0. However, OpenGL was supported; it was used by
  Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.
</p>
<p>
  In early releases of 4.0, numerous stability issues did occur as graphics and
  printer vendors had to change their drivers to be compatible with the kernel
  mode interfaces exported by GDI. The change to move the GDI to run in the same
  process context as its caller was prompted by complaints from NT Workstation
  users about real-time graphics performance, but this change put a considerable
  onus on hardware manufacturers to update device drivers.
</p>
<p>
  Windows NT 4.0 also included a new Windows Task Manager utility. Previous
  versions of Windows NT included the Task List utility, but it only shows
  applications currently on the desktop. To monitor CPU and memory usage, users
  were forced to use Performance Monitor. The task manager offers a more
  convenient way of getting a snapshot of all the processes running on the
  system at any given time.
</p>
<p>
  Internet Explorer 2 was bundled with Windows NT 4. The installation of
  Internet Explorer 4 on Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 3 or later) gave Windows
  NT 4.0 Active Desktop and browser integration into Windows Explorer, known as
  the Windows Desktop Update.
</p>
<p>
  Windows NT 4.0 upgraded NTVDM's x86 emulation in the RISC versions from 286 to
  486. Sysprep was introduced as a deployment tool with Windows NT 4.0.
</p>
<p>
  x86 versions of Windows NT 4.0 require the BIOS firmware. RISC versions of
  Windows NT 4.0 require the ARC firmware.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="editions">Editions</h2>
<p>There are numerous different editions of Windows NT 4.0. They include:</p>
<h3>Client</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Windows NT 4.0 Workstation</b> was designed for use as the general
    business desktop operating system.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Servers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Windows NT 4.0 Server</b>, released in 1996, was designed for small-scale
    business server systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition</b>, released in 1997, is the
    precursor to the Enterprise line of the Windows server family (Advanced
    Server in Windows 2000). Enterprise Server was designed for high-demand,
    high-traffic networks. Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition includes
    Service Pack 3. The Enterprise Edition saw the introduction of the /3GB boot
    flag, which changed the default virtual address space mapping from 2 GB
    kernel and 2 GB user space to 1 GB kernel and 3 GB userland. This version
    also sees the first introduction of cluster service.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition</b>, (known as Windows-based
    Terminal Server 4.0 and Windows Terminal Server 4.0 in beta builds) released
    on June 16, 1998, allows the users to log on remotely. The same
    functionality was called Terminal Services in Windows 2000 and later server
    releases, and also powers the Remote Desktop feature that first appeared in
    Windows XP and later versions of Windows. Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server
    Edition, like Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition, includes Service
    Pack 3.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Embedded</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Windows NT 4.0 Embedded</b>
    (abbreviated NTe) is an edition of Windows NT 4.0 that was aimed at
    computer-powered major appliances, vending machines, ATMs and other devices
    that cannot be considered general-purpose computers per se. It is the same
    system as the standard Windows NT 4.0, but it comes packaged in a database
    of components and dependencies, from which a developer can choose individual
    components to build customized setup CDs and hard disk boot images. Windows
    NT 4.0 Embedded includes Service Pack 5. It was succeeded by Windows XP
    Embedded. Microsoft ended mainstream support for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded on
    June 30, 2003, and received three years of extended support, which means
    that support for Windows NT 4.0 Embedded ended on the same day support for
    Windows 98 and Windows Me ended on July 11, 2006.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="level-one" id="user-interface">User Interface</h2>
<p>
  Microsoft's Windows NT 4.0 was the first version of the NT family to feature a
  GUI similar to that of Windows 95. Windows NT 4.0 introduced the user
  interface of Windows 95 to the Windows NT family, including the Windows shell,
  File Explorer (known as Windows NT Explorer at the time), and the use of "My"
  nomenclature for shell folders (e.g. My Computer). It also includes most
  components introduced with Windows 95. Internally, Windows NT 4.0 was known as
  the Shell Update Release (SUR). While many administrative tools, notably User
  Manager for Domains, Server Manager and Domain Name Service Manager still used
  the old graphical user interfaces, the Start menu in Windows NT 4.0 separated
  the per-user shortcuts and folders from the shared shortcuts and folders by a
  separator line. One significant difference from previous versions of Windows
  NT is that the Graphics Device Interface (GDI) is moved into kernel mode
  rather than being in user mode in the
  <abbr title="Client Server Runtime SubSystem">CSRSS process</abbr>. This
  eliminated a process-to-process context switch in calling GDI function, which
  results in a significant performance improvement over Windows NT 3.51,
  particularly in the graphical user interface. This, however, also mandated
  that graphics and printer drivers had to run in kernel mode as well, resulting
  in potential stability issues.
