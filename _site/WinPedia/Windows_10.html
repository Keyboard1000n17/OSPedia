  <p>
    Windows 10 is a major release of Microsoft's Windows NT operating system as
    the successor to Windows 8.1. It was released to manufacturing on July 15,
    2015, and later to retail on July 29, 2015. Windows 10 was made available
    for download via MSDN and TechNet, as a free upgrade for retail copies of
    Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 users via the Microsoft Store, and to Windows 7
    users via Windows Update. Unlike previous Windows NT releases, Windows 10
    receives new builds on an ongoing basis, which are available at no
    additional cost to users; devices in enterprise environments can
    alternatively use long-term support milestones that only receive critical
    updates, such as security patches.

    Unlike the tablet-oriented approach of Windows 8, Microsoft provided the
    desktop-oriented interface in line with previous versions of Windows in
    Windows 10. Other features added include Xbox Live integration, the virtual
    assistant Cortana, virtual desktops and the improved Settings component.
    Windows 10 also replaced Internet Explorer with Microsoft Edge. Like
    previous versions, Windows 10 has been developed primarily for x86
    processors; although a version of Windows 10 for ARM processors was released
    in 2018. Windows 10 received generally positive reviews upon its original
    release, and praise was given to the return of the desktop interface,
    improved bundled software compared to Windows 8.1, and other capabilities.
    However, media outlets were critical of behavioral changes of the system
    such as mandatory update installation, privacy concerns over data collection
    and the adware-like tactics used to promote the operating system on its
    release. Microsoft initially aimed to have Windows 10 installed on over one
    billion devices within three years of its release, but this goal was
    ultimately reached almost five years after release on March 16, 2020, and it
    surpassed Windows 7 as the most popular version of Windows worldwide by
    January 2018, which remains to be the case in 2024. Windows 10 is the
    most-used traditional PC operating system, with a 46% share of users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Windows 10 is the last version of Microsoft Windows that supports 32-bit
    processors (IA-32 and ARMv7-based), the last non-IoT edition to officially
    lack a CPU whitelist and support BIOS firmware, and the last version to
    officially support systems with TPM 1.2 or without any TPM at all. Support
    for Windows 10 editions which are not in the Long-Term Servicing Channel
    (LTSC) is set to end on October 14, 2025.

      At the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference in 2011, Andrew Lees, the
      chief of Microsoft's mobile technologies, said that the company intended
      to have a single software ecosystem for PCs, smartphones, tablets, and
      other devices: "We won't have an ecosystem for PCs, and one for phones,
      and one for tablets‍—‌they'll all come together."
    </p>

    <p>
      In December 2013, technology writer Mary Jo Foley reported that Microsoft
      was working on an update to Windows 8 codenamed "Threshold", after a
      planet in its Halo franchise. Similarly to "Blue" (which became Windows
      8.1), Foley described Threshold, not as a single operating system, but as
      a "wave of operating systems" across multiple Microsoft platforms and
      services, quoting Microsoft sources, scheduled for the second quarter of
      2015. She also stated that one of the goals for Threshold was to create a
      unified application platform and development toolkit for Windows, Windows
      Phone and Xbox One (which all use a similar kernel based on Windows NT).
    </p>

    <p>
      At the Build Conference in April 2014, Microsoft's Terry Myerson unveiled
      an early build of what would become Windows 10 (build 9697) that added the
      ability to run Microsoft Store apps inside desktop windows and a more
      traditional Start menu modeled after Windows 7's design by using only a
      portion of the screen and including an application listing in the left
      column, with the right column displaying Windows 8-style app tiles.
      Myerson said that these changes would occur in a future update, but did
      not elaborate. Microsoft also unveiled the concept of a "universal Windows
      app", allowing Windows Store apps created for Windows 8.1 to be ported to
      Windows Phone 8.1 and Xbox One while sharing a common codebase, with an
      interface designed for different device form factors, and allowing user
      data and licenses for an app to be shared between multiple platforms.
      Windows Phone 8.1 would share nearly 90% of the common Windows Runtime
      APIs with Windows 8.1 on PCs.
    </p>

    <p>
      A screenshot of a build identifying itself as "Windows Technical Preview"
      (numbered 9834) was leaked in September 2014, showing a new virtual
      desktop system, a notification center, and a new File Explorer icon.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Announcement</summary>
      <p>
        On September 30, 2014, Microsoft officially announced that Threshold
        would be unveiled during a media event as Windows 10. Myerson said that
        Windows 10 would be Microsoft's "most comprehensive platform ever",
        providing a single, unified platform for desktop and laptop computers,
        tablets, smartphones, and all-in-one devices. He emphasized that Windows
        10 would take steps towards restoring user interface mechanics from
        Windows 7 to improve the experience for users on non-touch devices,
        noting criticism of Windows 8's touch-oriented interface by keyboard and
        mouse users. Despite these concessions, Myerson noted that the
        touch-optimized interface would evolve as well on Windows 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        In regards to Microsoft naming the new operating system Windows 10
        instead of Windows 9, Terry Myerson said that "based on the product
        that's coming, and just how different our approach will be overall, it
        wouldn't be right to call it Windows 9." He also joked that they could
        not call it "Windows One" (referring to several recent Microsoft
        products with a similar brand, such as OneDrive, OneNote, and the Xbox
        One) because Windows 1.0 already existed. At a San Francisco conference
        in October 2014, Tony Prophet, Microsoft's Vice President of Windows
        Marketing, said that Windows 9 "came and went", and that Windows 10
        would not be "an incremental step from Windows 8.1", but "a material
        step. We're trying to create one platform, one eco-system that unites as
        many of the devices from the small embedded Internet of Things, through
        tablets, through phones, through PCs and, ultimately, into the Xbox."
      </p>

      <p>
        Further details surrounding Windows 10's consumer-oriented features were
        presented during another media event held on January 21, 2015, titled
        "Windows 10: The Next Chapter". The keynote featured the unveiling of
        Cortana integration within the operating system, new Xbox-oriented
        features, Windows 10 Mobile, an updated Office Mobile suite, Surface
        Hub‍ - a large-screened Windows 10 device for enterprise collaboration
        based upon Perceptive Pixel technology, along with HoloLens‑augmented
        reality eyewear and an associated platform for building apps that can
        render holograms through HoloLens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additional developer-oriented details surrounding the "Universal Windows
        Platform" concept were revealed and discussed during Microsoft's Build
        developers' conference. Among them were the unveiling of "Islandwood",
        which provides a middleware toolchain for compiling Objective-C-based
        software (particularly iOS) to run as universal apps on Windows 10 and
        Windows 10 Mobile. A port of Candy Crush Saga made using the toolkit,
        which shared much of its code with the iOS version, was demonstrated,
        alongside the announcement that the King-developed game would be bundled
        with Windows 10 at launch.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the 2015 Ignite conference, Microsoft employee Jerry Nixon stated
        that Windows 10 would be the "last version of Windows", a statement
        reflecting the company's intent to apply the software as a service
        business model to Windows, with new versions and updates to be released
        over an indefinite period. In 2021, however, Microsoft announced that
        Windows 10 would be succeeded on compatible hardware by Windows 11 – and
        that Windows 10 support will end on October 14, 2025, marking a
        departure from what had been dubbed "Windows as a service".

      <summary class="level-two">Marketing</summary>
      <p>
        On July 20, 2015, Microsoft began "Upgrade Your World", an advertising
        campaign centering on Windows 10, with the premiere of television
        commercials in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United
        Kingdom, and the United States. The commercials focused on the tagline
        "A more human way to do", emphasizing new features and technologies
        supported by Windows 10 that sought to provide a more "personal"
        experience to users. The campaign culminated with launch events in
        thirteen cities on July 29, 2015, which celebrated "the unprecedented
        role our biggest fans played in the development of Windows 10".

      <summary class="level-two">Release</summary>
      <p>
        On July 29, 2015, Microsoft officially announced that Windows 10 would
        be released for retail purchase as a free upgrade from earlier versions
        of Windows. In comparison to previous Windows releases, which had a
        longer turnover between the release to manufacturing (RTM) and general
        release to allow for testing by vendors (and in some cases, the
        development of "upgrade kits" to prepare systems for installation of the
        new version), an HP executive explained that because it knew Microsoft
        targeted the operating system for a 2015 release, the company was able
        to optimize its then-current and upcoming products for Windows 10 in
        advance of its release, negating the need for such a milestone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The general availability build of Windows 10, numbered 10240, was first
        released to Windows Insider channels for pre-launch testing on July 15,
        2015, prior to its formal release. Although a Microsoft official said
        there would be no specific RTM build of Windows 10, 10240 was described
        as an RTM build by media outlets because it was released to all Windows
        Insider members at once (rather than to users on the "Fast ring" first),
        it no longer carried pre-release branding and desktop watermark text,
        and its build number had mathematical connections to the number 10 in
        reference to the operating system's naming. The Enterprise edition was
        released to volume licensing on August 1, 2015.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 10 is distributed digitally through the "Media Creation Tool",
        which is functionally identical to the Windows 8 online installer, and
        can also be used to generate an ISO image or USB install media. In-place
        upgrades are supported from most editions of Windows 7 with Service Pack
        1 and Windows 8.1 with Update 1, while users with Windows 8 must first
        upgrade to Windows 8.1. Changing between architectures (e.g., upgrading
        from 32-bit edition to a 64-bit editions) via in-place upgrades is not
        supported; a clean installation is required. In-place upgrades may be
        rolled back to the device's previous version of Windows, provided that
        30 days have not passed since installation, and backup files were not
        removed using Disk Cleanup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 10 was available in 190 countries and 111 languages upon its
        launch, and as part of efforts to "re-engage" with users in China,
        Microsoft also announced that it would partner with Qihoo and Tencent to
        help promote and distribute Windows 10 in China, and that Chinese PC
        maker Lenovo would provide assistance at its service centers and retail
        outlets for helping users upgrade to Windows 10. At retail, Windows 10
        is priced similarly to editions of Windows 8.1, with U.S. prices set at
        $119 and $199 for Windows 10 Home and Pro respectively. A Windows 10 Pro
        Pack license allows upgrades from Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro.
        Retail copies only ship on USB flash drive media; however, system
        builder copies still ship as DVD-ROM media. New devices shipping with
        Windows 10 were also released during the operating system's launch
        window.
      </p>
    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Free upgrade offer</summary>
      <p>
        During its first year of availability, upgrade licenses for Windows 10
        could be obtained at no charge for devices with a genuine license for an
        eligible edition of Windows 7 or 8.1.
      </p>

      <p>
        This offer did not apply to Enterprise editions, as customers under an
        active Software Assurance (SA) contract with upgrade rights are entitled
        to obtain Windows 10 Enterprise under their existing terms. All users
        running non-genuine copies of Windows, and those without an existing
        Windows 7 or 8/8.1 license, were ineligible for this promotion; although
        upgrades from a non-genuine version were possible, they result in a
        non-genuine copy of 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the general availability build of Windows 10 (the original release),
        to activate and generate the "digital entitlement" for Windows 10, the
        operating system must have first been installed as an in-place upgrade.
        During the free upgrade, a "genuineticket.xml" file is created in the
        background and the system's motherboard details are registered with a
        Microsoft Product Activation server. Once installed, the operating
        system can be reinstalled on that particular system via normal means
        without a product key, and the system's license will automatically be
        detected via online activation – in essence, the Microsoft Product
        Activation Server will remember the system's motherboard and give it the
        green light for product re-activation. Because of installation issues
        with Upgrade Only installs, the November Update (version 1511) included
        additional activation mechanisms. This build treated Windows 7 and
        Windows 8/8.1 product keys as Windows 10 product keys, meaning they
        could be entered during installation to activate the free license,
        without the need to upgrade first to "activate" the hardware with
        Microsoft's activation servers. For major Original Equipment
        Manufacturers (OEMs), Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 OEM product keys are
        embedded in the firmware of the motherboard and if the correct edition
        of Windows 10 is present on the installation media, they are
        automatically inputted during installation. Since the release of the
        Fall Creators Update (version 1709), Microsoft decided to release
        multi-edition installation media, to alleviate installation and product
        activation issues users experienced because of accidentally installing
        the wrong edition of Windows 10.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Windows Insider Preview version of Windows 10 automatically updated
        itself to the generally released version as part of the version
        progression and continues to be updated to new beta builds, as it had
        throughout the testing process. Microsoft explicitly stated that Windows
        Insider was not a valid upgrade path for those running a version of
        Windows that is ineligible for the upgrade offer; although, if it was
        not installed with a license carried over from an in-place upgrade to 10
        Insider Preview from Windows 7 or 8.1, the Insider Preview does remain
        activated as long as the user does not exit the Windows Insider program.
      </p>

      <p>
        The offer was promoted and delivered via the "Get Windows 10"
        application (also known as GWX), which was automatically installed via
        Windows Update ahead of Windows 10's release, and activated on systems
        deemed eligible for the upgrade offer. Via a notification area icon,
        users could access an application that advertised Windows 10 and the
        free upgrade offer, check device compatibility, and "reserve" an
        automatic download of the operating system upon its release. On July 28,
        a pre-download process began in which Windows 10 installation files were
        downloaded to some computers that had reserved it. Microsoft said that
        those who reserved Windows 10 would be able to install it through GWX in
        a phased rollout process. The operating system could alternatively be
        downloaded at any time using a separate "Media Creation Tool" setup
        program, that allows for the creation of DVD or USB installation media.
      </p>

      <p>
        In May 2016, Microsoft announced that the free upgrade offer would be
        extended to users of assistive technologies; however, Microsoft did not
        implement any means of certifying eligibility for this offer, which some
        outlets thereby promoted as being a loophole to fraudulently obtain a
        free Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft said that the offer is not intended
        to be used in this manner. In November 2017, Microsoft announced that
        this program would end on December 31, 2017.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, another method was found that allowed Windows 7 and 8/8.1 users
        to upgrade to Windows 10 using existing licenses, even though the free
        upgrade offers officially ended in 2017. Some outlets have continued to
        promote it as a free method of upgrading from the now-unsupported
        Windows 7. This free upgrade method was officially closed by Microsoft
        on September 20, 2023. However, as of 2024, there are some reports that
        it still works, under certain conditions.

    <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 10 makes its user experience and functionality more consistent
      between different classes of device, and addresses many shortcomings of
      the user interface introduced in Windows 8. Windows 10 Mobile, the
      successor to Windows Phone 8.1, shared some user interface elements and
      apps with its PC counterpart.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows 10 supports universal apps, an expansion of the Metro-style first
      introduced in Windows 8. Universal apps can be designed to run across
      multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code - including
      PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems, Xbox One, Surface Hub and
      Mixed Reality. The Windows user interface was revised to handle
      transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a touchscreen-optimized
      interface based on available input devices - particularly on 2-in-1 PCs.
      Both interfaces include an updated Start menu which incorporates elements
      of Windows 7's traditional Start menu with the tiles of Windows 8. Windows
      10 also introduced the Microsoft Edge web browser, a virtual desktop
      system, a window and desktop management feature called Task View, support
      for fingerprint and face recognition login, new security features for
      enterprise environments, and DirectX 12.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Windows Runtime app ecosystem was revised into the Universal Windows
      Platform (UWP). These universal apps are made to run across multiple
      platforms and device classes, including smartphones, tablets, Xbox One
      consoles, and other devices compatible with Windows 10. Windows apps share
      code across platforms, have responsive designs that adapt to the needs of
      the device and available inputs, can synchronize data between Windows 10
      devices (including notifications, credentials, and allowing cross-platform
      multiplayer for games), and are distributed through the Microsoft Store
      (rebranded from Windows Store since September 2017). Developers can allow
      "cross-buys", where purchased licenses for an app apply to all of the
      user's compatible devices, rather than only the one they purchased on
      (e.g., a user purchasing an app on PC is also entitled to use the
      smartphone version at no extra cost).
    </p>

    <p>
      The ARM version of Windows 10 allows running applications for x86
      processors through 32-bit software emulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Windows 10, the Microsoft Store serves as a unified storefront for
      apps, video content, and eBooks. Windows 10 also allows web apps and
      desktop software (using either Win32 or .NET Framework) to be packaged for
      distribution on the Microsoft Store. Desktop software distributed through
      Windows Store is packaged using the App-V system to allow sandboxing.
    </p>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">System security</summary>
      <p>
        Windows 10 incorporates multi-factor authentication technology based
        upon standards developed by the FIDO Alliance. The operating system
        includes improved support for biometric authentication through the
        Windows Hello platform. Devices with supported cameras (requiring
        infrared illumination, such as Intel RealSense) allow users to log in
        with iris or face recognition, similarly to Kinect. Devices with
        supported readers allow users to log in through fingerprint recognition.
        Support was also added for palm-vein scanning through a partnership with
        Fujitsu in February 2018. Credentials are stored locally and protected
        using asymmetric encryption.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2017, researchers demonstrated that Windows Hello could be bypassed
        on fully-updated Windows 10 version 1703 with a color printout of a
        person's picture taken with an IR camera. In 2021, researchers were
        again able to bypass the Windows Hello functionalities by using custom
        hardware disguised as a camera, which presented an IR photo of the
        owner's face.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to biometric authentication, Windows Hello supports
        authentication with a PIN. By default, Windows requires a PIN to consist
        of four digits, but can be configured to permit more complex PINs.
        However, a PIN is not a simpler password. While passwords are
        transmitted to domain controllers, PINs are not. They are tied to one
        device, and if compromised, only one device is affected. Backed by a
        Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip, Windows uses PINs to create strong
        asymmetric key pairs. As such, the authentication token transmitted to
        the server is harder to crack. In addition, whereas weak passwords may
        be broken via rainbow tables, TPM causes the much-simpler Windows PINs
        to be resilient to brute-force attacks.

        When Windows 10 was first introduced, multi-factor authentication was
        provided by two components: Windows Hello and Passport (not to be
        confused with the Passport platform of 1998). Later, Passport was merged
        into Windows Hello.

        The enterprise edition of Windows 10 offers additional security
        features; administrators can set up policies for the automatic
        encryption of sensitive data, selectively block applications from
        accessing encrypted data, and enable Device Guard‍—‌a system which
        allows administrators to enforce a high-security environment by blocking
        the execution of software that is not digitally signed by a trusted
        vendor or Microsoft. Device Guard is designed to protect against
        zero-day exploits, and runs inside a hypervisor so that its operation
        remains separated from the operating system itself.

        The console windows based on Windows Console (for any console app, not
        just PowerShell and Windows Command Prompt) can now be resized without
        any restrictions, can be made to cover the full screen by pressing Alt +
        Enter, and can use standard keyboard shortcuts, such as those for cut,
        copy, and paste. Other features such as word wrap and transparency were
        also added. These functions can be disabled to revert to the legacy
        console if needed.

        The Anniversary Update added Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which
        allows the installation of a user space environment from a supported
        Linux distribution that runs natively on Windows. The subsystem
        translates Linux system calls to those of the Windows NT kernel (only
        claims full system call compatibility as of WSL 2, included in a later
        Windows update). The environment can execute the Bash shell and 64-bit
        command-line programs (WSL 2 also supports 32-bit Linux programs and
        graphics, assuming supporting software installed, and GPUs support for
        other uses). Windows applications cannot be executed from the Linux
        environment, and vice versa. Linux distributions for Windows Subsystem
        for Linux are obtained through Microsoft Store. The feature initially
        supported an Ubuntu-based environment; Microsoft announced in May 2017
        that it would add Fedora and OpenSUSE
      </p>
      environment options as well.

      <summary class="level-two">Storage requirements</summary>
      <p>
        To reduce the storage footprint of the operating system, Windows 10
        automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage
        footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5 GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6
        GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a
        performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which
        tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system
        performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime
        system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant,
        allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the
        operation, and further reducing the amount of space required for Windows
        10 by up to 12 GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced
        on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity
        devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the
        compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery.
        Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows
        users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is
        being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain
        types of files are saved to internal storage or an SD card by default.

        Windows 10 introduces Microsoft Edge, a new default web browser. It
        initially featured a new standards-compliant rendering engine derived
        from Trident, and also includes annotation tools and integration with
        other Microsoft platforms present within Windows 10. Internet Explorer
        11 is maintained on Windows 10 for compatibility purposes, but is
        deprecated in favor of Edge and, since mid-June 2022, is no longer
        supported on editions which follow Microsoft's Modern Lifecycle Policy.
        The initial version of Edge was later succeeded by a new iteration
        derived from the Chromium Project and Blink layout engine, which
        replaced the previous EdgeHTML-based version of Edge (renamed "Microsoft
        Edge Legacy"), and is bundled with the OS by default from build 20H2
        onwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 10 incorporates a universal search box located alongside the
        Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed into a
        single button. Previous versions featured Microsoft's intelligent
        personal assistant Cortana, which was first introduced with Windows
        Phone 8.1 in 2014, and supports both text and voice input. Many of its
        features are a direct carryover from Windows Phone, including
        integration with Bing, setting reminders, a Notebook feature for
        managing personal information, as well as searching for files, playing
        music, launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails.
        Since the November 2019 update, Microsoft has begun to downplay Cortana
        as part of a repositioning of the product towards enterprise use, with
        the May 2020 update removing its Windows shell integration and
        consumer-oriented features.

        Microsoft Family Safety is replaced by Microsoft Family, a parental
        controls system that applies across Windows platforms and Microsoft
        online services. Users can create a designated family, and monitor and
        restrict the actions of users designated as children, such as access to
        websites, enforcing age ratings on Microsoft Store purchases, and other
        restrictions. The service can also send weekly e-mail reports to parents
        detailing a child's computer usage. Unlike previous versions of Windows,
        child accounts in a family must be associated with a Microsoft account -
        which allows these settings to apply across all Windows 10 devices that
        a particular child is using.
      </p>

      <p>
        Windows 10 also offers the Wi-Fi Sense feature originating from Windows
        Phone 8.1; users can optionally have their device automatically connect
        to suggested open hotspots, and share their home network's password with
        contacts (either via Skype, People, or Facebook) so they may
        automatically connect to the network on a Windows 10 device without
        needing to manually enter its password. Credentials are stored in an
        encrypted form on Microsoft servers and sent to the devices of the
        selected contacts. Passwords are not viewable by the guest user, and the
        guest user is not allowed to access other computers or devices on the
        network. Wi-Fi Sense is not usable on 802.1X-encrypted networks. Adding
        "_optout" at the end of the SSID will also block the corresponding
        network from being used for this feature.

        Universal calling and messaging apps for Windows 10 are built in as of
        the November 2015 update: Messaging, Skype Video, and Phone. These offer

        Windows 10 provides greater integration with the Xbox ecosystem. Xbox
        SmartGlass is succeeded by the Xbox Console Companion (formerly the Xbox
        app), which allows users to browse their game library (including both PC
        and Xbox console games), and Game DVR is also available using a keyboard
        shortcut, allowing users to save the last 30 seconds of gameplay as a
        video that can be shared to Xbox Live, OneDrive, or elsewhere. Windows
        10 also allows users to control and play games from an Xbox One console
        over a local network. The Xbox Live SDK allows application developers to
        incorporate Xbox Live functionality into their apps, and future wireless
        Xbox One accessories, such as controllers, are supported on Windows with
        an adapter. Microsoft also intends to allow cross-purchases and save
        synchronization between Xbox One and Windows 10 versions of games;
        Microsoft Studios games such as ReCore and Quantum Break are intended as
        being exclusive to Windows 10 and Xbox One.

        Windows 10 adds native game recording and screenshot capture ability
        using the newly introduced Game Bar. Users can also have the OS
        continuously record gameplay in the background, which then allows the
        user to save the last few moments of gameplay to the storage device.

      <p>
        Windows 10 adds FLAC and HEVC codecs and support for the Matroska media

        Windows 10 includes DirectX 12, alongside WDDM 2.0. Unveiled March 2014
        at GDC, DirectX 12 aims to provide "console-level efficiency" with
        "closer to the metal" access to hardware resources, and reduced CPU and
        graphics driver overhead. Most of the performance improvements are
        achieved through low-level programming, which allow developers to use
        resources more efficiently and reduce single-threaded CPU bottlenecking
        caused by abstraction through higher level APIs. DirectX 12 will also
        feature support for vendor agnostic multi-GPU setups. WDDM 2.0
        introduces a new virtual memory management and allocation system to
        reduce workload on the kernel-mode driver.

    <summary class="level-one">Editions</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 10 is available in five main editions for personal computing
      devices; the Home and Pro editions of which are sold at retail in most
      countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Home is aimed at
      home users, while Pro is aimed at power users and small businesses. Each
      edition of Windows 10 includes all of the capabilities and features of the
      edition below it, and adds additional features oriented towards its market
      segments; for example, Pro adds additional networking and security
      features such as BitLocker, Device Guard, Windows Update for Business, and
      the ability to join a domain. Enterprise and Education, contain additional
      features aimed towards business environments, and are only available
      through volume licensing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of Microsoft's unification strategies, Windows products that are
      based on Windows 10's common platform but meant for specialized platforms
      are marketed as editions of the operating system, rather than as separate
      product lines. An updated version of Microsoft's Windows Phone operating
      system for smartphones, and also tablets, was branded as Windows 10
      Mobile. Editions of Enterprise and Mobile will also be produced for
      embedded systems, along with Windows 10 IoT Core, which is designed
      specifically for use in small footprint, low-cost devices and Internet of
      Things (IoT) scenarios and is similar in scope to Windows Embedded
      Compact.

    <p>
      On May 2, 2017, Microsoft unveiled Windows 10 S (referred to in leaks as
      Windows 10 Cloud), a feature-limited edition of Windows 10 which was
      designed primarily for devices in the education market (competing, in
      particular, with ChromeOS netbooks), such as the Surface Laptop that
      Microsoft also unveiled at this time. The OS restricts software
      installation to applications obtained from Microsoft Store; the device may
      be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro for a fee to enable unrestricted software
      installation. As a time-limited promotion, Microsoft stated that this
      upgrade would be free on the Surface Laptop until March 31, 2018. Windows
      10 S also contains a faster initial setup and login process, and allows
      devices to be provisioned using a USB drive with the Windows Intune for
      Education platform. In March 2018, Microsoft announced that Windows 10 S
      would be deprecated because of market confusion and would be replaced by
      "S Mode", an OEM option wherein Windows defaults to only allowing
      applications to be installed from Microsoft Store, but does not require
      payment in order to disable these restrictions.

    <summary class="level-one">User Interface</summary>
    <p>
      Windows 10 makes its user experience and functionality more consistent
      between different classes of device, and addresses many shortcomings of
      the user interface introduced in Windows 8. Windows 10 Mobile, the
      successor to Windows Phone 8.1, shared some user interface elements and
      apps with its PC counterpart. Windows 10 supports universal apps, an
      expansion of the Metro-style first introduced in Windows 8. Universal apps
      can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with
      nearly identical code including PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded
      systems, Xbox One, Surface Hub and Mixed Reality. The Windows user
      interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented
      interface and a touchscreen-optimized interface based on available input
      devices - particularly on 2-in-1 PCs. Both interfaces include an updated
      Start menu which incorporates elements of Windows 7's traditional Start
      menu with the tiles of Windows 8. Windows 10 also introduced the Microsoft
      Edge web browser, a virtual desktop system, a window and desktop
      management feature called Task View, support for fingerprint and face
      recognition login, new security features for enterprise environments, and
      DirectX 12. The Windows Runtime app ecosystem was revised into the
      Universal Windows Platform (UWP). These universal apps are made to run
      across multiple platforms and device classes, including smartphones,
      tablets, Xbox One consoles, and other devices compatible with Windows 10.
      Windows apps share code across platforms, have responsive designs that
      adapt to the needs of the device and available inputs, can synchronize
      data between Windows 10 devices (including notifications, credentials, and
      allowing cross-platform multiplayer for games), and are distributed
      through the Microsoft Store (rebranded from Windows Store since September
      2017). Developers can allow "cross-buys", where purchased licenses for an
      app apply to all of the user's compatible devices, rather than only the
      device they purchased the app on (e.g., a user purchasing an app on PC is
      also entitled to use the smartphone version at no extra cost). The ARM
      version of Windows 10 allows running applications for x86 processors
      through 32-bit software emulation. On Windows 10, the Microsoft Store
      serves as a unified storefront for apps, video content, and eBooks.
      Windows 10 also allows web apps and desktop software to be packaged for
      distribution on the Microsoft Store. Desktop software distributed through
      Windows Store is packaged using the App-V system to allow sandboxing.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new iteration of the Start menu is used on the Windows 10 desktop, with
      a list of places and other options on the left side, and tiles
      representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and
      expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet
      mode. A new virtual desktop system was added by a feature known as Task
      View, which displays all open windows and allows users to switch between
      them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Universal apps, which
      previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now be used in
      self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can
      now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner.
      When a window is snapped to one side of the screen, Task View appears and
      the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of
      the screen (called "Snap Assist") The Windows system icons have also been
      changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Windows 10 is designed to adapt its user interface based on the type of
      device being used and available input methods. It offers two separate user
      interface modes: a user interface optimized for mouse and keyboard, and a
      "Tablet mode" designed for touchscreens. Users can toggle between these
      two modes at any time, and Windows can prompt or automatically switch when
      certain events occur, such as disabling Tablet mode on a tablet if a
      keyboard or mouse is plugged in, or when a 2-in-1 PC is switched to its
      laptop state. In Tablet mode, programs default to a maximized view, and
      the taskbar contains a back button and hides buttons for opened or pinned
      programs by default; Task View is used instead to switch between programs.
      The full screen Start menu is used in this mode, similarly to Windows 8,
      but scrolls vertically instead of horizontally.
