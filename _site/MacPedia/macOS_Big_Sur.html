<p>
  macOS Big Sur (version 11) is the seventeenth major release of macOS, Apple's
  operating system for Macintosh computers. It was announced at Apple's
  Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 22, 2020, and was released to
  the public on November 12, 2020.
</p>
<div id="info">

    alt="macOS Big Sur logo"
    style="height: 35vh"
  />
  <p>Developed by: Apple Computer, Inc.</p>
  <p>
    General availability: November 12, 2020 (version 11.0 build 19A583 -
    original Software Update release)
  </p>
  <p>
    Last release: July 20, 2022 (version 11.7.10 build 20G1427 - final security
    update; scroll down and click on "Release History" for all builds)
  </p>
  <p>Preceded by: macOS Catalina (version 10.15)</p>
  <p>Succeeded by: macOS Monterey (version 12)</p>
  <p>Kernel type: Hybrid (XNU)</p>
  <p>
    Support status: Unsupported as of September 26, 2023. Finder is still able
    to download driver updates to sync to newer devices.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Big Sur is the successor to macOS Catalina (macOS 10.15). The release of Big
  Sur was the first time the major version number of the operating system had
  been incremented since the Mac OS X Public Beta in 2000. After sixteen
  distinct versions of macOS 10 ("Mac OS X"), macOS Big Sur was presented as
  version 11 in 2020, and four subsequent versions incremented the major version
  number, similarly to previous versions of Apple's other OSes.
</p>
<p>
  For the first time since OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) six years earlier,
  macOS Big Sur features a user interface redesign. It features new blurs to
  establish a visual hierarchy, along with making icons more square and UI
  elements more consistent. Other changes include a revamp of the Time Machine
  backup mechanism, and the addition of the Control Center (which was previously
  introduced, exclusively for touch devices, with iOS 7). It is also the first
  macOS version to support Macs with ARM-based processors. To mark the
  transition, the operating system's major version number was incremented, for
  the first time since 2001, from 10 to 11. The operating system is named after
  the coastal region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California, continuing
  the naming trend of California locations that began with OS X Mavericks.
</p>
<p>
  macOS Big Sur is the final version of macOS that supports Macs with Nvidia
  graphics cards, specifically the 15-inch dual graphics late 2013 and mid 2014
  MacBook Pro models, as its successor, macOS Monterey, drops support for those
  models.
</p>
<p>
  Providing some indication as to how the pre-release operating system may have
  been viewed internally at Apple during its development cycle, documentation
  accompanying the initial beta release of macOS Big Sur referred to its version
  as "10.16", and when upgrading from prior versions of macOS using the Software
  Update mechanism to early beta releases, the version referred to was "10.16".
  An exception to this was the Developer Transition Kit, which always reported
  the system version as "11.0". macOS Big Sur started reporting the system
  version as "11.0" on all Macs as of the third beta release.
</p>

<p>
  To maintain backwards compatibility, macOS Big Sur identified itself as 10.16
  to legacy software and in the browser user agent.
</p>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Unlike macOS Catalina, which supported every standard configuration Mac that
    Mojave supported, Big Sur drops support for various Macs released in 2012
    and early 2013. Big Sur runs on the following Macs:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Mid 2014 or later)</li>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2013 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Late 2013 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Late 2014 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (Late 2013 or later)</li>
    <li>Developer Transition Kit (only up to Big Sur 11.3 beta 2)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    By using patcher tools (such as OpenCore Legacy), macOS 11 Big Sur can be
    installed on earlier computers that are officially unsupported, such as the
    2012 iMac and the 2012 MacBook Pro. Using these methods, it is possible to
    install macOS Big Sur on computers as old as a 2008 MacBook Pro and iMac and
    2009 Mac Mini running smooth with non-metal graphics.

  <summary class="level-one">Features and Changes</summary>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">System</summary>
    <span class="level-three">Support for Apple silicon</span>
    <p>
      macOS Big Sur is the first release of macOS for Macs powered by
      Apple-designed ARM64-based processors, a key part of the transition from
      Intel x86-64-based processors. The chip mentioned in demo videos, and used
      in the Developer Transition Kit, is the A12Z Bionic. On November 10, 2020,
      Apple announced the first Mac Apple silicon chip, the Apple M1, in the
      Late 2020 Mac Mini, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro. Apple has said that it
      will support Intel Macs "for years to come", and most software that has
      not been ported to run on ARM Macs can use Rosetta 2, an update of a
      compatibility mechanism originally developed for the PowerPC-to-Intel x86
      transition. Likewise, Apple also introduced an updated universal binary
      format, Universal 2, which allows developers to package their applications
      so that they can run natively on both ARM64 and x86-64 processors.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Support for iOS and iPadOS applications</span>
    <p>
      On Macs based on Apple silicon, macOS Big Sur can run iOS and iPadOS
      applications natively and without any modifications needed from
      developers, aside from allowing the app to be available on the Mac App
      Store. The first Macs with this capability are those that use the Apple M1
      SoC (system on a chip).
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Time Machine overhaul</span>
    <p>
      Time Machine, the backup mechanism introduced back in Mac OS X 10.5
      Leopard, has been overhauled to utilize the APFS file system (introduced
      in MacOS High Sierra) instead of the outdated HFS+. Specifically, the new
      version of Time Machine makes use of APFS's snapshot technology. According
      to Apple, this enables "faster, more compact, and more reliable backups"
      than were possible previously with HFS+-formatted backup destinations. An
      independent evaluation of this claim found that Time Machine on macOS 11
      in conjunction with APFS was 2.75-fold faster upon initial local backup
      and 4-fold faster upon subsequent backups relative to macOS 10.15's Time
      Machine implementation using HFS+. A more modest yet nevertheless
      significant advantage was noted as well for backups to network-attached
      disks.
    </p>
    <p>
      New local (i.e. USB- or Thunderbolt-connected) and network-connected Time
      Machine backup destinations are formatted as APFS by default, though Time
      Machine can continue backing up to existing HFS+ backup volumes. There is
      no option to convert existing, HFS+-based backups to APFS; instead, users
      who want to benefit from the advantages of the new, APFS-based
      implementation of Time Machine need to start with a fresh volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the new version of Time Machine, encryption appears to be required
      (instead of merely optional) for local disks, but it remains elective for
      networked volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no longer possible to restore the whole system using a Time Machine
      backup, as the signed system volume is not backed up. Non-core
      applications and user data can be restored in full using Migration
      Assistant, preceded by a system reinstall if necessary.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Spotlight</span>
    <p>
      Spotlight, the file system indexing-and-search mechanism introduced in Mac
      OS X 10.4 Tiger, is faster and the interface has been refined. Spotlight
      is now the default search mechanism in Safari, Pages, and Keynote.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Signed system volume</span>
    <p>
      The system volume containing the core operating system is
      cryptographically signed. Apple indicates this is a security measure to
      prevent malicious tampering. This includes adding an SHA-256 hash for
      every file on the system volume, preventing changes from third-party
      entities and the end user.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Software updates</span>
    <p>
      Software updates can begin in the background before a restart, thus
      requiring less downtime to complete. Because system files are
      cryptographically signed, the update software can rely on them being in
      precise locations, thus permitting them to be effectively updated in
      place.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Encryption</span>
    <p>
      macOS Big Sur supports encryption at the file level. Earlier versions of
      macOS (10.15 Catalina and older) supported encryption only at the level of
      entire volumes. As of June 2020, this capability is known to be compatible
      with Macs based on Apple silicon; it is unclear whether it is compatible
      with Intel-based Macs.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Application features</summary>
    <span class="level-three">Safari</span>
    <p>
      Big Sur includes Safari 14, which was also released for macOS Catalina and
      macOS Mojave on September 16, 2020. Safari 14 includes features such as a
      new home page in which users can customize what features are visible in
      addition to being able to set a custom wallpaper. It also allows the
      viewer to preview a page and favicon before visiting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safari 14 also includes built-in web page translations in English,
      Spanish, German, French, Russian, Chinese and Portuguese as well as
      support for 4K HDR content from Netflix on Macs with an Apple T2 chip,
      although none of these were made available for macOS Catalina and Mojave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Privacy features such as iCloud Keychain (which notifies users of
      compromised passwords), extension privacy management and Privacy Report
      (which monitors privacy trackers and further increases Safari's security)
      were added for Safari 14. Users were now also able to import password from
      Google's Chrome browser in addition to being notified of compromised
      passwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safari 14 also supports WebExtensions API, the WebP image format as well
      as VP9 decoding, the latter of which allows for the playback of 4K and HDR
      content from YouTube. In addition, it allowed for better performance and
      power efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Safari 14 ended support for Adobe Flash Player in September, three months
      prior to its end-of-life on December 31, 2020.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Messages</span>
    <p>
      The Messages app was rewritten to be based upon Apple's Catalyst
      technology to enable it to have feature parity with its iOS counterpart.
      The new version of the app included a refined design as well as the
      ability to pin up to nine conversations that can sync across iOS, iPadOS
      and macOS. Users were also now allowed to search for messages and share
      their names and photos. Photo thumbnails could now also be used for group
      chats on the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, users could mention contacts by putting the @ symbol in front
      of their name. They were also able to reply to specific messages. Memojis,
      3d avatars were also made available on Messages. On Messages, users could
      now select photos based on parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      In India, text message effects were added when users sent certain texts
      (e.g., texting "Happy Holi" will result in users seeing effects).
    </p>
