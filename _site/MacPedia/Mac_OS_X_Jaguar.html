<p>
  Mac OS X Jaguar (version 10.2) is the third major release of macOS, Apple's
  desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.1 and preceded
  Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was released on August 23, 2002. It was
  available both for single-computer installations and in a "family pack" that
  allowed five installations on separate computers in one household. Jaguar was
  the first Mac OS X release to publicly use its code name in marketing and
  advertisements.

  <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Mac OS X Jaguar requires a PowerPC G3 or G4 CPU and 128 MB of RAM. Special
    builds were released for the first PowerPC G5 systems released by Apple.
  </p>

  <summary class="level-one">New and changed features</summary>
  <p>
    Jaguar introduced many new features to Mac OS X, which are still supported
    to this day, including MPEG-4 support in QuickTime, Address Book, and
    Inkwell for handwriting recognition. It also included the first release of
    Apple's Zeroconf implementation, Rendezvous (later renamed to Bonjour),
    which allows devices on the same network to automatically discover each
    other and offer available services, such as file sharing, shared scanners,
    and printers, to the user.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mac OS X Jaguar Server 10.2.2 added journaling to HFS Plus, the native
    Macintosh file system, to add increased reliability and data recovery
    features. This was later added to the standard Mac OS X in version 10.3
    Panther.
  </p>

  <p>
    Jaguar saw the debut of Quartz Extreme, a technology used to composite
    graphics directly on the video card, without the use of software to
    composite windows. The technology allotted the task of drawing the 3D
    surface of windows to the video card, rather than to the CPU, to increase
    interface responsiveness and performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Universal Access was added to allow the Macintosh to be usable by disabled
    computer users.
  </p>

  <p>
    The user interface of Jaguar was also updated to add search features to the
    Finder, powered by Sherlock 3.
  </p>

  <p>
    Internally, Jaguar also added the Common Unix Printing System (also known as
    CUPS), a modular printing system for Unix-like operating systems, and
    improved support for Microsoft Windows networks using the open-source Samba
    as a server for the SMB remote file access protocol and a FreeBSD-derived
    virtual file system module as a client for SMB.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Happy Mac startup icon that was introduced with the original Macintosh
    was replaced with a grey Apple logo. The gray startup screen was used up
    until OS X Yosemite.
