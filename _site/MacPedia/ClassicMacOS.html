<p>
  Mac OS (originally System Software; retronym: Classic Mac OS) is the series of
  operating systems developed for the Macintosh family of personal computers by
  Apple Computer, Inc. from 1984 to 2001, starting with System 1 and ending with
  Mac OS 9. The Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized
  the graphical user interface concept. It was included with every Macintosh
  that was sold during the era in which it was developed, and many updates to
  the system software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new
  Macintosh systems.

<p>
  Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984. The first version
  of the system software, which had no official name, was partially based on the
  Lisa OS, which Apple previously released for the Lisa computer in 1983. As
  part of an agreement allowing Xerox to buy shares in Apple at a favorable
  price, it also used concepts from the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former
  Apple CEO Steve Jobs and other Lisa team members had previewed. This operating
  system consisted of the Macintosh Toolbox ROM and the "System Folder", a set
  of files that were loaded from disk. The name Macintosh System Software came
  into use in 1987 with System 5. Apple rebranded the system as Mac OS in 1996,
  starting officially with version 7.6, due in part to its Macintosh clone
  program. That program ended after the release of Mac OS 8 in 1997. The last
  major release of the system was Mac OS 9 in 1999.
</p>

<p>
  Initial versions of the System Software ran one application at a time. With
  the Macintosh 512K, a system extension called the Switcher was developed to
  use this additional memory to allow multiple programs to remain loaded. The
  software of each loaded program used the memory exclusively; only when
  activated by the Switcher did the program appear, even the Finder's desktop.
  With the Switcher, the now familiar Clipboard feature allowed copy and paste
  between the loaded programs across switches including the desktop.
</p>

<p>
  With the introduction of System 5, a cooperative multitasking extension called
  MultiFinder was added, which allowed content in windows of each program to
  remain in a layered view over the desktop, and was later integrated into
  System 7 as part of the operating system along with support for virtual
  memory. By the mid-1990s, however, contemporary operating systems such as
  Windows NT, OS/2, NeXTSTEP, BSD, and Linux had all brought pre-emptive
  multitasking, protected memory, access controls, and multi-user capabilities
  to desktop computers. The Macintosh's limited memory management and
  susceptibility to conflicts among extensions that provide additional
  functionality, such as networking or support for a particular device, led to
  significant criticism of the operating system, and was a factor in Apple's
  declining market share at the time.
</p>

<p>
  After two aborted attempts at creating a successor to the Macintosh System
  Software called Taligent and Copland, and a four-year development effort
  spearheaded by Steve Jobs's return to Apple in 1997, Apple replaced Mac OS
  with a new operating system in 2001 named Mac OS X. It retained most of the
  user interface design elements of the Classic Mac OS, and there was some
  overlap of application frameworks for compatibility, but the two operating
  systems otherwise have completely different origins and architectures.
</p>

<p>
  The final updates to Mac OS 9 released in 2001 provided interoperability with
  Mac OS X. The name "Classic" that now signifies the historical Mac OS as a
  whole is a reference to the Classic Environment, a compatibility layer that
  helped ease the transition to Mac OS X (now macOS).
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="initial-concept">Initial concept</h2>
<p>
  The Macintosh project started in late 1978 with Jef Raskin, who envisioned an
  easy-to-use, low-cost computer for the average consumer. In September 1979,
  Raskin began looking for an engineer who could put together a prototype. Bill
  Atkinson, a member of the Apple Lisa team, introduced Raskin to Burrell Smith,
  a service technician who had been hired earlier that year.
</p>

<p>
  Apple's concept for the Macintosh deliberately sought to minimize the user's
  awareness of the operating system. Many basic tasks that required more
  operating system knowledge on other systems could be accomplished by mouse
  gestures and graphic controls on a Macintosh. This would differentiate it from
  its contemporaries such as MS-DOS, which use a command-line interface
  consisting of terse, abbreviated textual commands.
</p>

<p>
  In January 1981, Steve Jobs completely took over the Macintosh project. Jobs
  and a number of Apple engineers visited Xerox PARC in December 1979, three
  months after the Lisa and Macintosh projects had begun. After hearing about
  the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC from former Xerox
  employees like Raskin, Jobs negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer
  and Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The final
  Lisa and Macintosh operating systems use concepts from the Xerox Alto, but
  many elements of the graphical user interface were created by Apple including
  the menu bar, pull-down menus, and the concepts of drag and drop and direct
  manipulation.
</p>

<p>
  Unlike the IBM PC, which uses 8 kB of system ROM for power-on self-test (POST)
  and basic input/output system (BIOS), the Mac ROM is significantly larger (64
  kB) and holds key OS code. Much of the original Mac ROM code was written by
  Andy Hertzfeld, a member of the original Macintosh team. He was able to
  conserve precious ROM space by writing routines in assembly language code
  optimized with "hacks", or clever programming tricks. In addition to the ROM,
  he also coded the kernel, the Macintosh Toolbox, and some of the desktop
  accessories (DAs). The icons of the operating system, which represent folders
  and application software, were designed by Susan Kare, who later designed the
  icons for Microsoft Windows 3.0. Bruce Horn and Steve Capps wrote the
  Macintosh Finder, as well as a number of Macintosh system utilities.
</p>

<p>
  Apple aggressively advertised their new machine. After its release, the
  company bought all 39 pages of advertisement space in the 1984
  November/December edition of Newsweek magazine. The Macintosh quickly outsold
  its more sophisticated but much more expensive predecessor, the Lisa. Apple
  quickly developed MacWorks, a product that allowed the Lisa to emulate
  Macintosh system software through System 3, by which time it had been
  discontinued as the rebranded Macintosh XL. Many of the Lisa's operating
  system advances would not appear in the Macintosh operating system until
  System 7 or later.
</p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 20px">
  <span class="level-two">Compatibility</span>
  <p>
    Early versions of Mac OS are compatible only with Motorola 68000-family
    Macintoshes. As Apple introduced computers with PowerPC hardware, the OS was
    ported to support this architecture. Mac OS 8.1 is the last version that
    could run on a 68k processor (the 68040).
  </p>

  <p>
    In systems prior to PowerPC G3-based systems, significant parts of the
    system are stored in physical ROM on the motherboard. The initial purpose of
    this is to avoid having the OS use up most of the 128KiB RAM of the initial
    Macintosh—the initial ROMs were 64KiB. This architecture also allows for a
    completely graphical OS interface at the lowest level without the need for a
    text-only console or command-line mode: boot time errors, such as finding no
    functioning disk drives, are communicated to the user graphically, usually
    with an icon or the distinctive Chicago bitmap font and a Chime of Death or
    a series of beeps. This is in contrast to MS-DOS and CP/M computers of the
    time, which display such messages in a mono-spaced font on a black
    background, and require the use of the keyboard rather than a mouse, for
    input. To provide such niceties at a low level, early Mac OS depends on core
    system software in ROM on the motherboard, which also ensured that only
    Apple computers or licensed clones (with the copyright-protected ROMs from
    Apple) can run Mac OS.
  </p>

  <span class="level-two">File systems</span>
  <p>
    The Macintosh originally used the Macintosh File System (MFS), a flat file
    system with only one level of folders. This was quickly replaced in 1985 by
    the Hierarchical File System (HFS), which had a true directory tree. Both
    file systems are otherwise compatible. An improved file system named HFS
    Plus ("HFS+" or "Mac OS Extended") was announced in 1997 and implemented in
    1998.
  </p>

  <p>
    Files in most file systems used with DOS, Windows, Unix, or other operating
    systems have only one "fork". By contrast, MFS and HFS give files two
    different "forks". The data fork contains the same sort of information as a
    file in other file systems, such as the text of a document or the bitmaps of
    an image file. The resource fork contains other structured data such as menu
    definitions, graphics, sounds, or code segments that would be incorporated
    into a program's file format on other systems. An executable file might
    consist only of resources (including code segments) with an empty data fork,
    while a data file might have only a data fork with no resource fork. A word
    processor file could contain its text in the data fork and styling
    information in the resource fork so that an application that does not
    recognize the styling information can still read the raw text.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the other hand, these forks would challenge interoperability with
    different operating systems. In copying or transferring a Mac OS file to a
    non-Mac system, the default implementations would strip the file of its
    resource fork. Most data files contained only nonessential information in
    their resource fork, such as window size and location, but program files
    would be inoperative without their resources. This necessitated such
    encoding schemes as BinHex and MacBinary, which allowed a user to encode a
    dual-forked file into a single stream, or inversely take a single stream
    so-encoded and reconstitute it into a dual-forked file usable by Mac OS.
  </p>

<h2 class="level-one" id="release-history">Release history</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 20px">
  <h2 class="level-two">System 1, 2, 3, and 4</h2>
  <p>
    As part of Apple's goal of creating a computer with appliance-like
    simplicity, there was no explicit distinction made between the operating
    system software and the hardware it runs on. Because of this, early versions
    of the operating system do not have a distinct name. The software consists
    of two user-visible files: the System file, and the Finder, an application
    used for file management that also displays the Desktop. The two files are
    contained in a folder directory labeled "System Folder", which contains
    other resource files, like a printer driver, needed to interact with the
    System. Version numbers of the operating system are based on the version
    numbers of these two files.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      System 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0 use a flat file system named Macintosh File
      System (MFS). The Finder provides virtual folders that could be used to
      organize files, but these folders are not visible from any other
      application and do not exist on the disk.
    </li>
    <li>
      System 2.0 added support for AppleTalk and the newly introduced
      LaserWriter to use it.
    </li>
    <li>
      System 2.1 (Finder 5.0) introduced the Hierarchical File System (HFS)
      which has real directories. This version was specifically to support the
      Hard Disk 20 and only implements HFS in RAM; startup and most floppy disks
      remain MFS 400 K volumes.
    </li>
    <li>
      System 3.0 (Finder 5.1) was introduced with the Macintosh Plus, officially
      implementing HFS, 800K startup drives, support for several new
      technologies including SCSI and AppleShare, and Trash "bulging" (i.e.,
      when the Trash contains files, it gains a bulged appearance).
    </li>
    <li>
      System 4.0 was released with the Macintosh SE and System 4.1 first shipped
      with the Macintosh II—these new machines required additional support for
      the first expansion slots, the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), internal hard
      drives and, on the Macintosh II, external color displays and the first
      Motorola 68020 processor. System 4.0 was the first release to support
      color graphics; previous releases did not support color.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These releases can only run one application at a time, except for desk
    accessories, though special application shells such as Multi-Mac or Switcher
    (discussed under MultiFinder) could work around this. Visible changes are
    best reflected in the version number of the Finder, where major leaps are
    found between 1.x, 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x.
  </p>

  <h2 class="level-two">System Software 5</h2>
  <p>
    Towards the end of 1987, Apple introduced a package titled "Apple Macintosh
    System Software Update 5.0". For the first time, the Macintosh operating
    system was offered as a distinct retail product that included four 800K
    disks and three manuals, at a cost of US$49. The software itself was still
    freely available through user groups and bulletin board services. While the
    product box presented this update to the operating system as "version 5.0",
    this number does not appear in the software itself. Three of the four disks
    (System Tools 1, System Tools 2 and Utilities 1) are all bootable, and the
    user can boot off whichever floppy contains the tools the user needs. For
    instance, System Tools 2 is the only disk with printer drivers, and
    Utilities 1 is the only disk with Disk First Aid and Apple HD SC Setup.
    Because the disks are named System Tools, users and the press commonly
    referred to this version as "System Tools 5.0".
  </p>

  <p>
    The primary new feature of System 5 is MultiFinder, an extension that lets
    the system run several programs at once. The system uses a cooperative
    multitasking model, meaning that time is given to the background
    applications only when the foreground application yields control. A change
    in system functions that applications were already calling to handle events
    make many existing applications share time automatically, as well as being
    allowed to perform tasks in the background. Users can also choose not to use
    MultiFinder, thereby using a single application at a time. In 1990 InfoWorld
    tested four multitasking options for PC and Mac, viewing MultiFinder
    positively overall, but noting that its presence halved the speed of file
    transfer and printing compared to the single-tasking System 6 without
    MultiFinder.
  </p>

  <h2 class="level-two">System Software 6</h2>

  <p>
    Mac OS 9, the last major revision of the Classic Mac OS, was released on
    October 23, 1999. It is generally a steady evolution from Mac OS 8. Early
    development releases of Mac OS 9 were numbered 8.7.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mac OS 9 added improved support for AirPort wireless networking. It
    introduced an early implementation of multi-user support. Though not a true
    multi-user operating system, Mac OS 9 does allow multiple desktop users to
    have their own data and system settings. An improved Sherlock search engine
    added several new search plug-ins. Mac OS 9 also provides a much improved
    memory implementation and management. AppleScript was improved to allow
    TCP/IP and networking control. Mac OS 9 also makes the first use of the
    centralized Apple Software Update to find and install OS and hardware
    updates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other new features included its on-the-fly file encryption software with
    code signing and Keychain technologies, Remote Networking and File Server
    packages, and much improved list of USB drivers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mac OS 9 also added some transitional technologies to help application
    developers adopt some Mac OS X features before the introduction of the new
    OS to the public, to help ease the transition. These included new APIs for
    the file system and the bundling of the Carbon library that apps could link
    against instead of the traditional API libraries—apps that were adapted to
    do this could be run natively on Mac OS X as well. Other changes were made
    beginning with the Mac OS 9.1 update to allow it to be launched in the
    Classic Environment within Mac OS X.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 class="level-one" id="transition-to-mac-os-x">Transition to Mac OS X</h2>
<p>
  macOS (originally "Mac OS X" and then "OS X") is Apple's current Mac operating
  system that officially succeeded the Classic Mac OS in 2001. Although it was
  originally marketed as simply "version 10" of Mac OS, it has a history that is
  largely independent of the earlier Mac OS company, and its CEO Steve Jobs
  returned to Apple. macOS also makes use of the BSD codebase and the XNU
  kernel, and its core set of components is based upon Apple's open source
  Darwin operating system.
</p>

<p>
  An early version of the operating system, Mac OS X Server 1.0, was released in
  1999. It retains the "Platinum" appearance from the Classic Mac OS and even
  resembles OPENSTEP in places, with the first version to arrive with the new
  Aqua user interface. The first consumer version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released
  on March 24, 2001, supporting the new Aqua user interface. Mac OS X was
  renamed "OS X" in 2011 and "macOS" in 2016.
</p>

  Users of the Classic Mac OS generally upgraded to Mac OS X, but it was
  criticized in its early years as more difficult and less user-friendly than
  the original Mac OS, for the lack of certain features that had not yet been
  reimplemented in the new OS, for being slower on the same hardware (especially
  older hardware), and for incompatibilities with the older OS. Because drivers
  (for printers, scanners, tablets, etc.) written for the older Mac OS were not
  compatible with Mac OS X, inconsistent program support with the Classic
  Environment program used to run the older operating system's programs on Mac
  OS X, and the lack of Mac OS X support for older Apple computers before late
  1997; some Macintosh users continued using the older Classic Mac OS for a few
  years after the original release of Mac OS X. Steve Jobs encouraged people to
  upgrade to Mac OS X by staging a mock funeral for Mac OS 9 at WWDC 2002.
