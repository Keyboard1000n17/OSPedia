<p>
  OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) is the 10th major release of macOS, Apple Inc.'s
  desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. OS X Mavericks
  was announced on June 10, 2013, at WWDC 2013, and was released on October 22,
  2013, worldwide. It was also the last version to use a mostly skeuomorphic
  design; the next release, OS X Yosemite, featured a redesign of the user
  interface appearance. It was also the first version of macOS to be offered
  only on the App Store, rather than on a physical disk.

    Mac App Store release)
  </p>
  <p>
    Last release: September 19, 2012 and October 4, 2012 (version 10.9.5 build
    13F1911 - final security update; scroll down and click on "Release History"

  </p>
</div>
<p>
  The update emphasized battery life, Finder improvements, other improvements
  for power users, and increased iCloud integration, as well as bringing more of
  Apple's iOS apps to OS X. Mavericks was named after the surfing location in
  Northern California.It also removed some of the skeuomorphic designs from OS X
  Mountain Lion, and it is the final version of macOS that features the Lucida
  Grande typeface as the standard system font since Mac OS X Public Beta in
  2000.
</p>
<p>
  Mavericks was the first OS X release to be named after a location in
  California, and the first to be a free upgrade since Mac OS X 10.1 Puma.

  <summary class="level-one">History</summary>
  <p>
    Apple announced OS X Mavericks on June 10, 2013, during the company's Apple
    Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote (which also introduced iOS 7,
    a revised MacBook Air, the sixth-generation AirPort Extreme, the
    fifth-generation AirPort Time Capsule, and a redesigned Mac Pro). During a
    keynote on October 22, 2013, Apple announced that the official release of
    10.9 on the Mac App Store would be available immediately, and that unlike
    previous versions of OS X, 10.9 would be available at no charge to all users
    running Snow Leopard (10.6.8) or later.
  </p>
  <p>
    On October 22, 2013, Apple offered free upgrades for life on OS X and iWork.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
  <p>
    All the Macs supporting OS X Mountain Lion support OS X Mavericks. As with
    Mountain Lion, 2 GB of RAM, 8 GB of available storage, and Mac OS X Snow
    Leopard or later are required. Mavericks and later versions are all
    available for free.
  </p>

  <p>Here is the full list of compatible models:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Mid 2007 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Aluminum, Late 2008 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later)</li>
    <li>Xserve (Early 2009)</li>
  </ul>

  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Added features</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The menu bar and the Dock are available on each display. Additionally,
        AirPlay compatible displays such as the Apple TV can be used as an
        external display. Mission Control has been updated to organize and
        switch between Desktop workspaces independently between multiple
        displays.
      </li>
      <li>
        OS X Mavericks introduced App Nap, which sleeps apps that are not
        currently visible. Any app running on Mavericks can be eligible for this
        feature by default.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compressed Memory is a virtual memory compression system which
        automatically compresses data from inactive apps when approaching
        maximum memory capacity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Timer coalescing is a feature that enhances energy efficiency by
        reducing CPU usage by up to 72 percent. This allows MacBooks to run for
        longer periods of time and desktop Macs to run cooler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Apple now supports OpenGL 4.1 Core Profile and OpenCL 1.2. Server
        Message Block version 2 (SMB2) is now the default protocol for sharing
        files, rather than AFP. This is to increase performance and
        cross-platform compatibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some skeuomorphs, such as the leather texture in Calendar, the legal pad
        theme of Notes, and the book-like appearance of Contacts, have been
        removed from the UI and replaced with flat design similar to iOS 7.
      </li>
      <li>
        iCloud Keychain stores a user's usernames, passwords and Wi-Fi passwords
        to allow the user to fill this information into forms when needed.
      </li>
      <li>The system has native LinkedIn sharing integration.</li>
      <li>
        IPoTB (Internet Protocol over Thunderbolt Bridge) Thunderbolt networking
        is supported in Mavericks. This feature allows the user to quickly
        transfer a large amount of data between two Macs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Notification Center allows the user to reply to notifications instantly,
        allows websites to send notifications, and, when the user wakes up a Mac
        that was in a sleep state, displays a summary of missed notifications
        before the machine is unlocked. Some system alerts, such as low battery,
        removal of drives without ejecting, and a failed Time Machine backup
        have been moved to Notification Center.
      </li>
      <li>
        The "traffic light" close, minimize, and maximize window buttons have
        appeared somewhat brighter than OS X Lion and OS X Mountain Lion.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Removed features</summary>
    <p>
      The Open Transport API has been removed. USB syncing of calendar, contacts
      and other information to iOS devices has been removed, instead requiring
      the use of iCloud. QuickTime 10 no longer supports many older video codecs
      and converts them to the ProRes format when opened. Older video codecs
      cannot be viewed in Quick Look. Apple also removed the ability to sync
      mobile iCloud Notes if iOS devices were upgraded from iOS 8 to iOS 9,
      effectively forcing all Mavericks users to update or upgrade their
      computers.
    </p>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">App features</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Finder gets enhancements such as tabs, full-screen support, and document
        tags. Pinch-to-zoom and swipe-to-navigate-history gestures have been
        removed, although both are supported anywhere else.
      </li>
      <li>
        The new iBooks application allows the user to read books purchased
        through the iBooks Store. The app also allows the user to purchase new
        content from the iBooks Store, and a night mode to make it easier to
        read in dark environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        The new Maps application adds the same functionalities that were
        featured in iOS Maps. Among these new features is the capability to
        search directions for driving and walking, report problems in the Maps
        application, and viewing street addresses to Maps via the Contacts
        application.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Calendar app has enhancements such as being able to add Facebook
        events, view the map of a specified location, and an estimate for the
        travel time to an event.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Safari browser has a significantly enhanced JavaScript performance
        which Apple claims is faster than Chrome and Firefox. A Top Sites view
        allows the user to quickly access the most viewed sites by default.
        However, the user can pin or remove websites from the view. The sidebar
        now allows the user to view their bookmarks, reading list and shared
        links. Safari can also auto-generate random passwords and remember them
        through iCloud Keychain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Additional changes were made to the messaging system. FaceTime is
        updated so that the user no longer needs to enable camera, in a similar
        manner to FaceTime in iOS 7. OS X Mavericks 10.9.2 added the option to
        block users in iMessage.
