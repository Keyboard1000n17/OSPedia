<p>
  Mac OS X Leopard (version 10.5) is the sixth major release of macOS, Apple's
  desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. Leopard was
  released on October 26, 2007 as the successor of Mac OS X Tiger, and is
  available in two editions: a desktop version suitable for personal computers,
  and a server version, Mac OS X Server. It retailed for $129 for the desktop
  version and $499 for Server. Leopard was superseded by Mac OS X Snow Leopard
  (version 10.6) in 2009. Mac OS X Leopard is the last version of macOS that
  supports the PowerPC architecture as its successor, Mac OS X Snow Leopard,
  functions solely on Intel based Macs.

<p>
  According to Apple, Leopard contains over 300 changes and enhancements
  compared to its predecessor, Mac OS X Tiger, covering core operating system
  components as well as included applications and developer tools. Leopard
  introduces a significantly revised desktop, with a redesigned Dock, Stacks, a
  semitransparent menu bar, and an updated Finder that incorporates the Cover
  Flow visual navigation interface first seen in iTunes. Other notable features
  include support for writing 64-bit graphical user interface applications, an
  automated backup utility called Time Machine, support for Spotlight searches
  across multiple machines, and the inclusion of Front Row and Photo Booth,
  which were previously included with only some Mac models.
</p>

<p>
  Apple missed Leopard's release time frame as originally announced by Apple's
  CEO Steve Jobs. When first discussed in June 2005, Jobs had stated that Apple
  intended to release Leopard at the end of 2006 or early 2007. A year later,
  this was amended to Spring 2007; however, on April 12, 2007, Apple issued a
  statement that its release would be delayed until October 2007 because of the
  development of the iPhone.
</p>

<p>
  Mac OS X Leopard is the first version of Mac OS X to run on the MacBook Air.
</p>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">System requirements</summary>
  <p>
    Apple states the following basic Leopard system requirements, although, for
    some specific applications and features (such as iChat backdrops) an Intel
    processor is required:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Processor: any Intel processor, or PowerPC G5 or G4 (867 MHz and faster)
      processor
    </li>
    <li>
      Optical drive: internal or external DVD drive (for installation of the
      operating system)
    </li>
    <li>
      Memory: minimum 512 MB of RAM (additional RAM (1 GB) is recommended for
      development purposes)
    </li>
    <li>Hard drive capacity: Minimum 9 GB of disk space available.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Leopard’s retail version was not released in separate versions for each type
    of processor, but instead consisted of one universal release that could run
    on both PowerPC and Intel processors. However, the install discs that ship
    with Intel-based Macs only contain Intel binaries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Processor type and speed are checked during installation and installation
    halted if insufficient; however, Leopard will run on slower G4 processor
    machines (e.g., a 733 MHz Quicksilver) if the installation is performed on a
    supported Mac and its hard drive then moved to a slower/unsupported one (the
    drive may either be an internal mechanism or a Firewire external).
  </p>

  <div class="div-level-two">
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Supported machines</summary>
      <p>
        Mac OS X Leopard can run on the later flat-panel iMac G4s, the iMac G5,
        iMac Intel Core Duo and iMac Intel Core 2 Duo, PowerBook G4, Power Mac
        G4, Power Mac G5, iBook G4, MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac Pro,
        Mac Mini, Xserve, Xserve G5, Xserve RAID, Macintosh Server G4, and later
        eMac models. Leopard can run on older hardware as long as they have a G4
        upgrade installed running at the 867 MHz or faster, have at least 9 GB
        free of hard drive space, 512 MB RAM and have a DVD drive. Leopard
        however will not run on the 900 MHz iBook G3 models even though they
        exceed the minimum 867 MHz requirement. This is due to the lack of
        AltiVec support in the G3 line of processors. Leopard can be "hacked"
        (see below) to install on these G3 and pre-867 MHz G4 machines but the
        system may behave erratically and many of the programs, features, and
        functions may not work properly or at all. As of mid-2010, some Apple
        computers have firmware factory installed which will no longer allow
        installation of Mac OS X Leopard. These computers only allow
        installation of Mac OS X Snow Leopard. However, some computers (such as
        the 2011 model of the Mac mini) can have Leopard installed on them
        without hacking.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Usage on unsupported hardware</summary>
      <p>
        Some ways of running Leopard on certain unsupported hardware, primarily
        PowerPC G4 computers with CPU speeds lower than the official requirement
        of 867 MHz, have been discovered. A common way is use of the program
        LeopardAssist, which is a bootloader similar in some respects to
        XPostFacto (used for installing earlier releases of Mac OS X on
        unsupported G3 and pre-G3 Macs) that uses the Mac’s Open Firmware to
        tell Leopard that the machine does have a CPU meeting the 867 MHz
        minimum requirement that the Installer checks for before installation is
        allowed to commence, when in reality the CPU is slower. Currently,
        LeopardAssist only runs on slower G4s and many people have installed
        Leopard successfully on these older machines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Users who have access to supported hardware have installed Leopard on
        the supported machine then simply moved the hard drive to the
        unsupported machine. Alternatively, the Leopard Installation DVD was
        booted on a supported Mac, then installed on an unsupported Mac via
        Firewire Target Disk Mode. Leopard is only compiled for AltiVec-enabled
        PowerPC processors (G4 and G5) though, as well as Intel, so both of
        these methods will only work on Macs with G4 or later CPUs. While some
        of the earlier beta releases were made to run on some later G3 machines
        (mostly later 800–900 MHz iBooks), no success with the retail version
        has been officially reported on G3 Macs except for some later iMacs and
        "Pismo" PowerBook G3s with G4 processor upgrades installed.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a number of months after Leopard's release it appeared that the only
        G3 Macs on which Leopard could be run were those with both an
        aftermarket G4 processor and an AGP graphics card, as failures with the
        OS partially booting before crashing were reported on older Macs such as
        the original tray-loading iMacs and the Beige and Blue &amp White Power
        Mac G3 (all with G4 upgrades as Leopard will not even begin to load
        without one) whereas it would boot fine on newer Macs where the
        Installer restriction had been circumvented. However, more recently it
        has been reported that with some more work and use of kernel extensions
        from XPostFacto, Tiger and beta builds of Leopard, the OS can be made to
        run on G4-upgraded Macs as old as the Power Macintosh 9500, despite the
        lack of AGP-based graphics. While Leopard can be run on any Mac with a
        G4 or later processor, some functionality such as Front Row or Time
        Machine fails to work without a Quartz Extreme-capable graphics card,
        which many of the earlier G4s did not include in their factory
        specification.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since Apple moved to using Intel processors in their computers, the
        OSx86 community has developed and now also allows Mac OS X Tiger and
        later releases to be installed and run successfully on non-Apple
        x86-based computers, albeit in violation of Apple's licensing agreement
        for Mac OS X.

      <summary class="level-two">End-user features</summary>
      <p>
        Apple advertised that Mac OS X Leopard has 300+ new features, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A new and improved Automator, with easy starting points to easily
          start a workflow. It also can quickly create or edit workflows with
          new interface improvements. Now it can use a new action called "Watch
          Me Do" that lets users record a user action (like pressing a button or
          controlling an application without built-in Automator support) and
          replay as an action in a workflow. It can create more useful Automator
          workflows with actions for RSS feeds, iSight camera video snapshots,
          PDF manipulation, and much more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Back to My Mac, a feature for MobileMe users that allows users to
          access files on their home computer while away from home via the
          internet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boot Camp, a software assistant allowing for the installation of other
          operating systems, such as Windows XP (SP2 or later) or Windows Vista,
          on a separate partition (or separate internal drive) on Intel-based
          Macs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dashboard enhancements, including Web Clip, a feature that allows
          users to turn a part of any Web page displayed in Safari into a live
          Dashboard widget, and Dashcode to help developers code widgets.
        </li>
        <li>
          New Desktop, comprises a redesigned 3-D dock with a new grouping
          feature called Stacks, which displays files in either a "fan" style,
          "grid" style, or (since 10.5.2) a "list" style. Rory Prior, on the
          ThinkMac blog, criticized the shelf-like Dock along with a number of
          other changes to the user interface.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dictionary can now search Wikipedia, and a dictionary of Apple
          terminology as well. Also included is the Japanese-language dictionary
          Daijisen, Progressive E-J and Progressive J-E dictionaries, and the
          25,000-word thesaurus Tsukaikata no Wakaru Ruigo Reikai Jiten, all of
          which are provided by the Japanese publisher Shogakukan.
        </li>
        <li>
          A redesigned Finder, with features similar to those seen in iTunes 7,
          including Cover Flow and a Source list-like sidebar.
        </li>
        <li>
          Front Row has been reworked to closely resemble the interface of the
          original Apple TV.
        </li>
        <li>
          iCal calendar sharing and group scheduling as well as syncing event
          invitations from Mail. The icon also reflects the current date even
          when the application is not running. In previous versions of Mac OS X,
          the icon would show July 17 in the icon any time the application was
          not running but the current date when the application was running.
        </li>
        <li>
          iChat enhancements, including multiple logins, invisibility, animated
          icons, and tabbed chats, similar to features present in Pidgin, Adium
          and the iChat plugin Chax; iChat Theater, allowing users to
          incorporate images from iPhoto, presentations from Keynote, videos
          from QuickTime, and other Quick Look features into video chats; and
          Backdrops, which are similar to chroma keys, but use a real-time
          difference matte technique which does not require a green or blue
          screen. iChat also implements screen sharing, a feature previously
          available with Apple Remote Desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mail enhancements including the additions of RSS feeds, Stationery,
          Notes, and to-dos. To-dos use a system-wide service that is available
          to all applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Network file sharing improvements include more granular control over
          permissions, consolidation of AFP, FTP and SMB sharing into one
          control panel, and the ability to share individual folders, a feature
          that had not been available since Mac OS 9.
        </li>
        <li>
          Parental controls now include the ability to place restrictions on use
          of the Internet and to set parental controls from anywhere using
          remote setup.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photo Booth enhancements, including video recording with real-time
          filters and blue/green-screen technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Podcast Capture, an application allowing users to record and
          distribute podcasts. It requires access to a computer running Mac OS X
          Server with Podcast Producer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preview adds support for annotation, graphics, extraction, search,
          markup, Instant Alpha and size adjustment tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          Quick Look, a framework allowing documents to be viewed without
          opening them in an external application and can preview it in full
          screen. Plug-ins are available for Quick Look so that users can also
          view other files, such as Installer Packages.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Finder, showing files in Cover Flow View and viewing a file using
          Quick Look
        </li>
        <li>Safari 3, which includes Web Clip.</li>
        <li>
          Spaces, an implementation of virtual desktops (individually called
          "Spaces"), allows multiple desktops per user, with certain
          applications and windows in each desktop. Users can organize certain
          Spaces for certain applications (e.g., one for work-related tasks and
          one for entertainment) and switch between them. Exposé works inside
          Spaces, allowing the user to see at a glance all desktops on one
          screen.) Users can create and control up to 16 spaces, and
          applications can be switched between each one, creating a very large
          workspace. The auto-switching feature in Spaces has annoyed some of
          its users. Apple added a new preference in 10.5.2 which disabled this
          feature, but there were still bugs found while switching windows. In
          10.5.3, this problem was addressed and was no longer an issue.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spotlight incorporates additional search capabilities such as Boolean
          operators, as well as the ability to search other computers (with
          appropriate permissions).
        </li>
        <li>
          Time Machine, an automated backup utility which allows the user to
          restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of
          a file. Though generally lauded in the press as a step forward for
          data recovery, Time Machine has been criticized in multiple
          publications for lacking the capabilities of third-party backup
          software. Analyzing the feature for TidBITS, Joe Kissell pointed out
          that Time Machine does not create bootable copies of backed-up
          volumes, does not back up to AirPort Disk hard drives and will not
          back up FileVault encrypted home directories until the user logs out,
          concluding that the feature is "pretty good at what it does" but he
          will only use it as part of a "broader backup strategy". One of these
          issues has been resolved, however; On March 19, 2008, updates were
          released for AirPort and Time Machine, allowing for Time Machine to
          use a USB hard disk which has been connected to an AirPort Extreme
          Base Station.
        </li>
        <li>
          Universal Access enhancements: significant improvements to
          applications including VoiceOver, along with increased support for
          Braille, closed captioning and a new high‐quality Speech synthesis
          voice.
        </li>
        <li>Russian language support, bringing the total to 18 languages.</li>
        <li>Leopard removes support for Classic applications.</li>

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary class="level-two">Developer technologies</summary>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Native support by many libraries and frameworks for 64-bit
          applications, allowing 64-bit Cocoa applications. Existing 32-bit
          applications using those libraries and frameworks should continue to
          run without the need for emulation or translation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leopard offers the Objective-C 2.0 runtime, which includes new
          features such as garbage collection. Xcode 3.0 supports the updated
          language and was itself rewritten with it.
        </li>
        <li>
          A new framework, Core Animation, allows a developer to create complex
          animations while specifying only a "start" and a "goal" space. The
          main goal of Core Animation is to enable the creation of complex
          animations with small amounts of program code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apple integrates DTrace from the OpenSolaris project and adds a
          graphical interface called Instruments (previously Xray). DTrace
          provides tools that users, administrators and developers can use to
          tune the performance of the operating system and the applications that
          run on it.
        </li>
        <li>
          The new Scripting Bridge allows programmers to use Python 2.5 and Ruby
          1.8.6 to interface with the Cocoa frameworks.
        </li>
        <li>Ruby on Rails is included in the default install.</li>
        <li>
          Leopard’s OpenGL stack has been updated to version 2.1, and uses LLVM
          to increase its vertex processing speed. Apple has been working to get
          LLVM integrated into GCC; LLVM’s use within other operating system
          facilities has not been announced.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Graphics and Media State of the Union address confirmed many other
          features are possible because of Core Animation, such as live
          desktops, improvements to Quartz Composer with custom patches, a new
          PDF Kit for developers, and improvements to QuickTime APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          The FSEvents framework allows applications to register for
          notifications of changes to a given directory tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leopard includes a read-only implementation of the ZFS file system.<br />
          In mid-December 2006, a pre-release version of Leopard appeared to
          include support for Sun’s ZFS. Jonathan Schwartz, CEO and President of
          Sun Microsystems, boasted on June 6, 2007, that ZFS had become "the
          file system" for Leopard. However, the senior project marketing
          director for Mac OS X stated on June 11, 2007, that the existing HFS+,
          not ZFS, would be used in Leopard. Apple later clarified that a
          read-only version of ZFS would be included.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leopard includes drivers for UDF 2.5, necessary for reading HD DVD and
          Blu-ray discs using third-party drives, but the included DVD Player
          software can only play HD DVDs authored by DVD Studio Pro.

          Leopard is the first operating system with open-source BSD code to be
          certified as fully UNIX-compliant. Certification means that software
          following the Single UNIX Specification can be compiled and run on
          Leopard without the need for any code modification. The certification
          only applies to Leopard when run on Intel processors.

      <summary class="level-two">Security enhancements</summary>
      <p>
        New security features intend to provide better internal resiliency to
        successful attacks, in addition to preventing attacks from being
        successful in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leopard implements library randomization, which randomizes the locations
        of some libraries in memory. Vulnerabilities that corrupt program memory
        often rely on known addresses for these library routines, which allow
        injected code to launch processes or change files. Library randomization
        is presumably a stepping-stone to a more complete implementation of
        address space layout randomization at a later date.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="level-three">Application Layer Firewall</span>
          <p>
            Leopard ships with two firewall engines: the original BSD IPFW,
            which was present in earlier releases of Mac OS X, and the new
            Leopard Application Layer Firewall. Unlike IPFW, which intercepts
            and filters IP datagrams before the kernel performs significant
            processing, the Application Layer Firewall operates at the socket
            layer, bound to individual processes. The Application Layer Firewall
            can therefore make filtering decisions on a per-application basis.
            Of the two firewall engines, only the Application Layer Firewall is
            fully exposed in the Leopard user interface. The new firewall offers
            less control over individual packet decisions (users can decide to
            allow or deny connections system-wide or to individual applications,
            but must use IPFW to set fine-grained TCP/IP header-level policies).
            It also makes several policy exceptions for system processes:
            neither mDNSResponder nor programs running with superuser privileges
            are filtered.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="level-three">Sandboxes</span>
          <p>
            Leopard includes kernel-level support for role-based access control
            (RBAC). RBAC is intended to prevent, for example, an application
            like Mail from editing the password database.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="level-three">Application Signing</span>
          <p>
            Leopard provides a framework to use public key signatures for code
            signing to verify, in some circumstances, that code has not been
            tampered with. Signatures can also be used to ensure that one
            program replacing another is truly an "update", and carry any
            special security privileges across to the new version. This reduces
            the number of user security prompts, and the likelihood of the user
            being trained to simply clicking "OK" to everything.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="level-three">Secure Guest Account</span>
          <p>
            Guests can be given access to a Leopard system with an account that
            the system erases and resets at logout.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Security features in Leopard have been criticized as weak or
        ineffective, with the publisher Heise Security documenting that the
        Leopard installer downgraded firewall protection and exposed services to
        attack even when the firewall was re-enabled. Several researchers noted
        that the Library Randomization feature added to Leopard was ineffective
        compared to mature implementations on other platforms, and that the new
        "secure Guest account" could be abused by Guests to retain access to the
        system even after the Leopard log out process erased their home
        directory.

  <summary class="level-one">User interface</summary>
  <p>
    Mac OS X Leopard made many changes to the user interface. This includes a
    more detailed, transparent menu bar, skeuomorphic system icons, and a
    glossy, reflective, 3D Dock. Windows lost their metallic, lined look they
    had previously. As well as this, the Apple icon is now black instead of
    blue. This is notably very similar to IPhone OS 1's user interface. Rory
    Prior, on the ThinkMac blog, criticized a number of changes to Leopard's
    user interface, including the transparent menu bar and the new folder icons.
    Decreased transparency of the menu bar, along with the ability to disable
    the menu bar transparency were added with the 10.5.2 release on February 11,
    2008.
