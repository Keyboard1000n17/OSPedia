<p>
  <i>NOT to be confused with OS X Mountain Lion, the succeeding version.</i>
</p>

<p>
  OS X Lion, also known as Mac OS X Lion, (version 10.7) is the eighth major
  release of macOS, Apple's desktop and server operating syste for Mac
  computers. A preview of OS X 10.7 Lion was publicly shown at the "Back to the
  Mac" Apple Special Event on October 20, 2010. It brought many developments
  made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of installed
  applications, to the Mac, and includes support for the Mac App Store, as
  introduced in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard version 10.6.6. On February 24, 2011,
  the first developer's preview of Lion (11A390) was released to subscribers to
  the Apple Developer program. Other developer previews were subsequently
  released, with Lion Preview 4 (11A480b) being released at WWDC 2011.

</div>

<p>
  Lion was released to manufacturing on July 1, 2011, followed by its final
  release via the Mac App Store on July 20, 2011. Apple reported over one
  million Lion sales on the first day of its release. As of October 2011, OS X
  Lion had sold over six million copies worldwide. Mac OS X 10.7.1 was the last
  version of Mac OS X released under CEO Steve Jobs. 10.7.2 and later were
  released under CEO Tim Cook. 10.7.5 added Gatekeeper. Lion is the first
  version of macOS that did not support 32-bit processors and is also the final
  release whose development was overseen by Bertrand Serlet, considered to be
  the "founding father of Mac OS X".
</p>
<p>
  Although originally paid, Apple later allowed free downloads of the OS,
  especially for customers of older and no longer officially supported Mac
  computers, starting on June 30, 2021. The same practice was applied to its
  successor, OS X Mountain Lion.
</p>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Release and distribution</summary>
  <p>
    On June 6, 2011, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, it was
    announced that the official release for Lion would be in July 2011. The
    specific release date of July 20 was not confirmed until the day before,
    July 19, by Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, as part of Apple's 2011
    third-quarter earnings announcement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apple did not initially announce any physical media distribution for Lion,
    such as a set of CD-ROMs or a DVD-ROM as used for past releases. Instead,
    the operating system was said to be available exclusively as a download from
    the Mac App Store for US$29.99. The only prior version of OS X that supports
    the Mac App Store is Snow Leopard, which implied that any machines that
    support Lion currently running Tiger or Leopard rewould first have to be
    upgraded to Snow Leopard, as opposed to allowing a direct upgrade to Lion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Apple later announced two alternative distribution mechanisms for the
    benefit of users without broadband Internet access: in-store downloads at
    retail Apple Stores, and a USB flash drive containing the OS, priced at
    US$69, available through the online Apple Store beginning in August. On
    August 4, 2011, Apple started to take orders for OS X Lion's USB
    installation flash drives for $69.99.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Server portion of Lion is available as a separate download from the Mac
    App Store for US$49.99, which is in addition to the purchase price of Lion
    itself. In July 2012, Lion was removed from the Mac App Store and retail
    Apple stores following the release of OS X Mountain Lion. Following the
    removal of Lion from the Mac App Store, customers could still purchase Lion
    by phone at the reduced price of $20. In October 2013, Lion was returned to
    the Apple Store website concurrently with Mountain Lion following the
    release of OS X Mavericks for the convenience of users who cannot run
    Mavericks on older Mac models.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Hardware support</summary>
  <p>
    The first developer preview of Lion added TRIM support for Solid-state
    drives (SSD) shipped with Macs, which is also included in the latest version
    of Snow Leopard (10.6.8) shipping with MacBook Pros before July 20, 2011.
    Other SSDs have built-in TRIM-like optimization, while yet others require OS
    patching.
  </p>
  <p>System requirements</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      x86-64 CPU (64-bit Macs, with an Intel Core 2 Duo, Intel Core i5, Intel
      Core i7, or Xeon processor.)
    </li>
    <li>At least 2 GB of memory</li>
    <li>Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later (Mac OS X 10.6.8 is recommended)</li>
    <li>7 GB of available space</li>
    <li>
      AirDrop is supported on the following Mac models: iMac (early 2009 or
      newer), MacBook (late 2008 or newer), MacBook Air (late 2010 or newer),
      MacBook Pro (late 2008 or newer), Mac Mini (mid 2010 or newer), and Mac
      Pro (early 2009 with AirPort Extreme card and mid 2010 or newer).

<details>
  <summary class="level-one">New and changed features</summary>
  <p>
    Some new features were announced at the "Back to the Mac" keynote in October
    2010, and the Apple website was updated in February 2011 with more details.
    Other features were announced at the WWDC 2011 keynote or on Apple's OS X
    Lion Web site after the keynote. Apple stated that there were over 250 new
    or changed features in Lion, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Address Book uses an iPad-like user interface. It also includes improved
      Yahoo support and FaceTime calling.
    </li>
    <li>
      AirDrop – Lion-to-Lion direct file sharing via Wi-Fi Direct, with no
      wireless access point required.
    </li>
    <li>
      Address space layout randomization – Address space layout randomization
      (ASLR), a security technique that puts important data in unpredictable
      locations, making it harder to target known weaknesses, is available for
      32-bit applications, and "has been improved for all applications", in
      Lion.
    </li>
    <li>
      Apple Push Notification Service – Send over-the-air alerts, such as news
      updates or social networking status changes, using Apple's Push
      Notification service to applications that support APNS. APNS allows OS X
      Lion and iOS clients to receive push changes to items such as mail,
      calendar and contacts from a configured OS X Lion Server.
    </li>
    <li>
      Auto-correction behaves much like on iOS devices, displaying an iOS-like
      popup box.
    </li>
    <li>
      Auto Save – As in iOS, documents in applications written to use Auto Save
      are saved automatically so users do not have to worry about manually
      managing their documents. The Auto Save feature significantly alters
      traditional workflow patterns and is a controversial addition to the
      system.
    </li>
    <li>
      Emoji support – Apple has added a new Emoji font commonly used in chat to
      express ideograms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Exposé in the Dock, a way of activating Exposé for a single application
      from the Dock, a feature added in Mac OS X 10.6, is altered. One must
      double-tap with two fingers on a dock icon to initiate single-application
      Exposé, or simply right-click or control-click and select Show All
      Windows.
    </li>
    <li>FaceTime comes bundled with Lion.</li>
    <li>
      FileVault offers full disk encryption and added security with XTS-AES 128
      data encryption. Support for FileVault on external hard drives has also
      been added.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finder improvements – Finder search allows multiple search criteria to be
      specified without creating a smart folder, Finder search offers
      suggestions, files can be grouped by various attributes, and one can merge
      files under two folders with the same name – a prompt appears asking to
      replace or keep both files. The navigation sidebar lost the ability to
      show the specific icon of a map or volume (by default; there is a hack to
      still add the old ability), instead it shows a grey standard map icon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Font Book 3 – Font Book 3 provides more flexible displays of character
      glyphs supplied by a particular font face. Duplicate font files are
      flagged with a warning icon, and can be fixed automatically or resolved
      manually.
    </li>
    <li>
      Full-screen apps – Native, system-wide support for full-screen
      applications running in their own space. Supporting applications display a
      new button at the top right of application window, this button opens
      applications in full-screen mode. However, full screen mode is not
      supported for dual screen setups.
    </li>
    <li>
      High-quality multilingual speech voices – users can download new
      high-quality voices in more than forty languages and dialects.
    </li>
    <li>
      iCal has an updated user interface, an annual view, and support for a
      full-screen view.
    </li>
    <li>
      iChat has support for logging into Yahoo! Messenger. Users can audio- and
      video-chat with other iChat users using their Yahoo! accounts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Languages/Localization – Arabic, Czech, Turkish and Hungarian are added as
      full system languages, to make the total number of twenty-two languages
      available in Mac OS X.
    </li>
    <li>
      Launchpad – An application launcher that displays an iOS-like icon grid of
      installed applications. It features the ability to make multiple pages and
      group apps into folders that function the same as folders in iOS.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mac App Store – receives support for in app purchases as with iOS, and
      alters the update mechanism to no longer create a separate copy of the
      app, improving performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mail 5 – Uses an iPad-like user interface, has a fullscreen-optimized
      view, uses chronological "Conversations" to organize messages, and
      supports Exchange 2010 (but not through the Exchange ActiveSync protocol,
      as iOS).
    </li>
    <li>
      Mission Control replaces the "All windows" Exposé feature. It gives an
      overview of all running applications just like "All windows" but groups
      windows from the same application. At the top of the screen it gives quick
      access to the Dashboard, Spaces, and running full-screen applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-touch gestures – Similar to iOS, additional gestures performed using
      a multi-touch input device (e.g. Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad) allow the
      user to scroll, swipe to different pages, and enter Mission Control. While
      this is not the first official multi-touch support for Mac OS X, it has
      been expanded; other frameworks, such as Lux, have already created
      multi-touch support.
    </li>
    <li>
      Multi-User Screen Sharing – The built-in Screen Sharing feature allows
      remote users to log into a separate user account from the one that is
      currently logged in. While one user is logged into a machine, a second
      user can log into the same machine remotely, seeing their own desktop and
      user environment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Preview gains several features, including full-screen support and the
      ability to sign a document just by holding a signed piece of paper up to
      the camera.
    </li>
    <li>
      Profile Manager provides several features, including push
      notification-based management of OS X Lion and above.
    </li>
    <li>
      QuickTime reincorporates some features from QuickTime Pro. New features
      cited include Copy/Paste, Insert Clip, Crop Video, Rotate Video, Resize,
      Trim, and more Export options.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recovery Partition – Apple has introduced a recovery partition that
      includes utilities generally found on the OS X discs. This partition
      enables the user to restore their computer to its original factory state
      without the original installer media such as a flash drive. If the
      partition were to become damaged or otherwise not available, such as with
      a new drive, a new copy of OS X Lion can be installed over the internet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Resume – Applications resume in the same state when re-opened as already
      seen in iOS.
    </li>
    <li>Safari – With full-screen mode and the new WebKit2 layout engine.</li>
    <li>
      System Information – This feature is a re-design of System Profiler, which
      has been completely altered with new views which display graphical
      information on displays, storage devices, memory usage along with other
      hardware information. The previous layout remains available by clicking
      "System Report". Early builds of Lion also used System Information as a
      replacement for "About This Mac", although the final release reinstated
      the version of this dialog box found in Snow Leopard.
    </li>
    <li>Terminal has extra features, including full screen mode.</li>
    <li>
      TextEdit gains a new graphical toolbar with font selection and text
      highlighting. The new TextEdit also supports Apple's new automatic file
      saving and versions technologies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Versions – Time Machine-like saving and browsing of past versions of
      documents for applications written to use Versions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Vertical text – Lion supports vertical layouts for East Asian languages.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The complete list was on Apple's website but has since been taken down; it
    can now be found on the Internet Archive. The developer release notes may
    also be of interest.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Server Features</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wiki Server 3 – Making it easier to collaborate, share, and exchange
        information. Users can quickly switch between a server's home page, My
        Page, Updates, Wikis, People, and Podcasts. File sharing is simpler, and
        a new Page Editor is added for easy customization.
      </li>
      <li>
        WebDAV File Sharing – Lion Server delivers wireless file sharing for
        clients that support WebDAV. Enabling WebDAV in Lion Server gives iOS
        users the ability to access, copy, and share documents on the server
        from applications such as Keynote, Numbers, and Pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Profile Manager – Profile Manager delivers simple, profile-based setup
        and management for OS X Lion, iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. It
        also integrates with existing directory services and delivers automatic
        over-the-air profile updates using the Apple Push Notification service.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">User interface changes</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Redesigned Aqua user interface elements, including new appearances for
        buttons and progress bars. The red, yellow, and green buttons in the
        window decorations have also been made smaller, with a slightly changed
        design.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flexible window resizing from any corner or edge of the window, similar
        to window resizing in Microsoft Windows and many window managers for
        X11.
      </li>
      <li>
        The metal finish has also been slightly altered. It is a lighter shade
        of grey and features a speckled texture.
      </li>
      <li>Scrollbar arrows have been removed.</li>
      <li>
        Scrolling is reversed by default, to act more like a touch screen
        device, so that content moves in the direction of finger movement on
        touch-pad or mouse (with the scrollbar moving in the opposite
        direction), rather than the scrollbar moving in the direction of finger
        movement (with the content moving in the opposite direction). Also, like
        in iOS, scrolling "bounces" when the scroll bar hits the top or bottom
        of the window.
      </li>
      <li>
        When resizing a window by clicking on the green button (left-top), a
        transform effect animates the enlargement.
      </li>
      <li>New windows fly to the front (like opening an app in iOS).</li>
      <li>
        The dashboard is its own space in Mission Control, rather than in
        previous versions of OS X where the widgets simply flew in and the
        background dimmed. As a result, there is no more "ripple effect" on the
        background when adding a widget, as was seen on previous versions of Mac
        OS X that had the previous dashboard. Users have the option to return
        the dashboard to its previous configuration in System Preferences.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tabs, when selected, have a recessed and darkened appearance as opposed
        to previous versions where selected tabs were highlighted in aqua blue.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Dropped features</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Save As – replaced by Duplicate and Revert functions due to the
        introduction of Auto Save and Versions (only applies to applications
        modified to support Auto Save, such as TextEdit; applications not
        modified to support Auto Save, such as Microsoft Word, retain this
        functionality).
      </li>
      <li>
        Front Row, a media center application. The application has been copied
        into Lion by third-party users, however its incompatibility with iTunes
        10.4 renders some features useless.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rosetta, software that makes possible the execution of PowerPC software
        on x86 hardware, is no longer available. This disables some programs
        that ran on previous versions of Mac OS X. Programs requiring Rosetta to
        operate are not allowed to be distributed via the Mac App Store.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adobe Flash Player and Apple's Java Runtime Environment (JRE) are not
        included in new installations of Lion, but both can still be downloaded
        and installed manually. Apple is no longer actively maintaining its JRE,
        but Software Update offers to download Snow Leopard's JRE when a user
        tries to run a Java program and the JRE is not installed. Programs using
        Java are not allowed to be distributed via the Mac App Store.
      </li>
      <li>
        iSync, software used for syncing contacts and calendars to third-party
        mobile phones, is no longer included; however, iSync v3.1.2 from Snow
        Leopard continues to work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remote Install Mac OS X, software that allows OS X to be installed using
        the Remote Disk feature. Using Target Disk Mode, users can circumvent
        this omission. This is replaced by the Recovery Partition, which does
        exactly the same thing but without needing an external disk, as long as
        the hard disk is not damaged.
      </li>
      <li>Apple USB Modem is not compatible with Lion.</li>
      <li>
        QuickTime Streaming Server, software used to deliver video and audio on
        request to users over a computer network, including the Internet.
      </li>
      <li>
        WPA Enterprise configuration for wireless networks was replaced by the
        requirement to obtain a configuration profile.
      </li>
      <li>The Post-Install Welcome Video was removed.</li>
    </ul>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Software incompatibilities</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Applications that depend on Rosetta, such as Office for Mac 2004,
        AppleWorks, and early versions of Quicken for Mac 2007, are no longer
        supported. This affects applications listed as Classic or PowerPC in
        System Profiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unix package managers for Mac OS X such as Fink and MacPorts require
        reinstalling and then running Xcode.
