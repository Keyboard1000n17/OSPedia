<h1 id="heading">macOS</h1>
<p>
  macOS (formerly OS X and originally Mac OS X) is Apple's Unix offering for a
  desktop operating system, derived from OPENSTEP for the Mach microkernel and
  FreeBSD. It is propietary and strictly limited to Apple's own desktops and
  laptops. macOS is currently the second-most used dekstop operating system,
  just behind Windows and ahead of all Linux distributions. The current latest
  version of macOS is macOS 26 Tahoe.
</p>
<p>
  The first Macintosh was released on January 14, 1984. The operating system
  that came with the Macintosh did not have a name and was partially based on
  Lisa OS for the Apple Lisa which was released in 1983. The name
  <b>Macintosh System Software</b> came into use in 1987 with the release of
  System 5. The name <b>Mac OS</b> was used with the release of Mac OS 7.6 due
  to the Macintosh clone program and the requirement for a more licensable name.
  The series of Macintosh operating systems up until Mac OS 9 is now called
  <b>Classic Mac OS</b>.
</p>
<p>
  In 2001, after a 4 year development effort, Apple released Mac OS X
  (pronounced "Mac OS 10") which was completely different from Classic Mac OS,
  both visually and architecturally. It was derived from NeXTSTEP, a Unix-like
  operating system developed by Steve Jobs during his time away from Apple,
  rather than on the previous version's code. The final versions of Mac OS 9
  provided some interoperability with Mac OS X.
</p>
<p>
  Apple shortened the name Mac OS X to OS X with the release of 10.7 Lion in
  2011. In 10.9 Mavericks, the naming convention was changed to reference places
  in California. Apple then changed OS X to macOS in 2016 with the release of
  10.12 Sierra to align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems. In
  2020, Apple released macOS Big Sur as version 11, a significant departure from
  the 10.xx versioning convention, but Apple continued to reference places in
  California in the names of the releases. 2025 saw Apple unifying the version
  number across all their products to align with the year after their Worldwide
  Developers Conference (WWDC), so the latest version is 26 Tahoe.

    Mac OS (originally System Software) is the series of operating systems
    developed for the Macintosh family of personal computers by Apple Computer,
    Inc. from 1984 to 2001, starting with System 1 and ending with Mac OS 9. The
    Macintosh operating system is credited with having popularized the graphical
    user interface concept. It was included with every Macintosh that was sold
    during the era in which it was developed, and many updates to the system
    software were done in conjunction with the introduction of new Macintosh
    systems.

  <p>
    Mac OS X 10.0 (code named Cheetah) is the first major release of macOS,
    Apple's desktop and server operating system. It was released on March 24,
    2001, for a price of $129 after a public beta. Mac OS X was Apple's
    successor to the classic Mac OS. It was derived from NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD,
    and featured a new user interface called Aqua, as well as improved stability
    and security due to its new Unix foundations. It introduced the Quartz
    graphics rendering engine for hardware-accelerated animations. Many
    technologies were ported from the classic Mac OS, including Sherlock and the
    QuickTime framework. The core components of Mac OS X were open sourced as
    Darwin.

    Mac OS X 10.1 (code named Puma) is the second major release of macOS,
    Apple's desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.0 and
    preceded Mac OS X Jaguar. Mac OS X 10.1 was released on September 25, 2001,
    as a free update for Mac OS X 10.0 users. The operating system was handed
    out for free by Apple employees after Steve Jobs' keynote speech at the
    Seybold publishing conference in San Francisco. It was subsequently
    distributed to Mac users on October 25, 2001, at Apple Stores and other
    retail stores that carried Apple products.

    desktop and server operating system. It superseded Mac OS X 10.1 and
    preceded Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was released on August 23,
    2002. It was available both for single-computer installations and in a
    "family pack" that allowed five installations on separate computers in one
    household. Jaguar was the first Mac OS X release to publicly use its code
    name in marketing and advertisements.

    'Unified' theme, and improved support for 64-bit addressing on Power Mac
    G5s. Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger also had a number of additional features that
    Microsoft had spent several years struggling to add to Windows with
    acceptable performance, such as fast file search and improved graphics
    processing.

    available in two editions: a desktop version suitable for personal
    computers, and a server version, Mac OS X Server. It retailed for $129 for
    the desktop version and $499 for Server. Leopard was superseded by Mac OS X
    Snow Leopard (version 10.6) in 2009. Mac OS X Leopard is the last version of
    macOS that supports the PowerPC architecture as its successor, Mac OS X Snow
    Leopard, functions solely on Intel based Macs.

  <p>
    Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) (also referred to as OS X Snow Leopard)
    is the seventh major release of macOS, Apple's desktop and server operating
    system for Macintosh computers. Snow Leopard was publicly unveiled on June
    8, 2009 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference. On August 28, 2009, it
    was released worldwide, and was made available for purchase from Apple's
    website and retail stores at the price of $29 USD for a single-user license.
    As a result of its low price, initial sales of Snow Leopard were
    significantly higher than those of its predecessors, with prices starting at
    $129 USD. The release of Snow Leopard came nearly two years after the launch
    of Mac OS X Leopard, the second longest time span between successive Mac OS
    X releases (the time span between Tiger and Leopard was the longest).

    OS X Lion, also known as Mac OS X Lion, (version 10.7) is the eighth major
    release of macOS, Apple's desktop and server operating syste for Mac
    computers. A preview of OS X 10.7 Lion was publicly shown at the "Back to
    the Mac" Apple Special Event on October 20, 2010. It brought many
    developments made in Apple's iOS, such as an easily navigable display of
    installed applications, to the Mac, and includes support for the Mac App
    Store, as introduced in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard version 10.6.6. On
    February 24, 2011, the first developer's preview of Lion (11A390) was
    released to subscribers to the Apple Developer program. Other developer
    previews were subsequently released, with Lion Preview 4 (11A480b) being
    released at WWDC 2011.

    OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8) is the ninth major release of macOS, Apple
    Inc.'s desktop and server operating system for Macintosh computers. OS X
    Mountain Lion was released on July 25, 2012, for purchase and download
    through the Mac App Store, as part of a switch to releasing OS X versions
    online and every year, rather than every two years. Named to signify its
    status as a refinement of the previous OS X version, Lion, Apple's stated
    aims in developing Mountain Lion were to allow users to more easily manage
    and synchronise content between multiple Apple devices and to make the
    operating system more familiar.

    and security. Following the California location-based naming scheme
    introduced with OS X Mavericks, El Capitan was named after the famous
    eponymous rock formation in Yosemite National Park. OS X El Capitan is the
    final version to be released under the name OS X. OS X El Capitan received
    far better reviews than Yosemite.

    macOS Sierra (version 10.12) is the thirteenth major release of macOS
    (formerly known as OS X and Mac OS X), Apple Inc.'s desktop and server
    operating system for Macintosh computers. The name "macOS" stems from the
    intention to unify the operating system's name with that of iOS, watchOS and
    tvOS. Sierra is named after the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California
    and Nevada. Specifically, Lone Pine Peak is the location for macOS Sierra's
    default wallpaper. Its major new features concern Continuity, iCloud, and
    windowing, as well as support for Apple Pay and Siri.

    Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. macOS High
    Sierra was announced at the WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017 and was released on
    September 25, 2017. The name "High Sierra" refers to the High Sierra region
    in California. Its name signified its goal to be a refinement of the
    previous macOS version, macOS Sierra, focused on performance improvements
    and technical updates rather than features. This makes it similar to
    previous macOS releases Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion and El Capitan. Among
    the apps with notable changes are Photos and Safari.

    2018, and was released to the public on September 24. The operating system's
    name refers to the Mojave Desert, continuing the use of California-themed
    names that began with OS X Mavericks. It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was
    followed by macOS Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that
    features the iTunes and Dashboard apps.

    released to the public on October 7, 2019. Catalina is the first version of
    macOS to support only 64-bit applications and the first to include
    Activation Lock. It is also the last version of macOS to have the major
    version number be 10.x; its successor, Big Sur, released on November 12,
    2020, is version 11. In order to increase web compatibility, Safari,
    Chromium and Firefox have frozen the OS in the user agent running in

    Apple's operating system for Macintosh computers. It was announced at
    Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 22, 2020, and was
    released to the public on November 12, 2020. For the first time since OS X
    Yosemite (version 10.10) six years earlier, macOS Big Sur features a user
    interface redesign. It features new blurs to establish a visual hierarchy,
    along with making icons more square and UI elements more consistent. Other
    changes include a revamp of the Time Machine backup mechanism, and the
    addition of the Control Center (which was previously introduced, exclusively
    for touch devices, with iOS 7). It is also the first macOS version to
    support Macs with ARM-based processors. To mark the transition, the
    operating system's major version number was incremented, for the first time
    since 2001, from 10 to 11. The operating system is named after the coastal
    region of Big Sur in the Central Coast of California, continuing the naming
    trend of California locations that began with OS X Mavericks.
