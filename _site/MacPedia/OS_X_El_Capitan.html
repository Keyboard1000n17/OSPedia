  OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) is the twelfth major release of macOS (named
  OS X at the time of El Capitan's release), Apple Inc.'s desktop and server
  operating system for Macintosh. It focuses mainly on performance, stability,
  and security. Following the California location-based naming scheme introduced
  with OS X Mavericks, El Capitan was named after the famous eponymous rock
  formation in Yosemite National Park. OS X El Capitan is the final version to
  be released under the name OS X. OS X El Capitan received far better reviews
  than Yosemite.

<p>
  The first beta of OS X El Capitan was released to developers shortly following
  the WWDC keynote on June 8, 2015. The first public beta was made available on
  July 9, 2015. There were multiple betas released after the keynote. OS X El
  Capitan was released to end users on September 30, 2015, as a free upgrade
  through the Mac App Store.
</p>
<p>
  OS X El Capitan is the final version of OS X to support aluminum Macs and
  Xserve, as its successor macOS Sierra is incompatible with the mid-2007 and
  final models of these products.
</p>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    All Macs supporting OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks, and OS X Yosemite
    support OS X El Capitan, although not all of its features will work on older
    models. For example, Apple notes that the newly available Metal API is
    available on "all Macs since 2012".
  </p>
  <p>
    These computers can run OS X El Capitan, provided they have at least 2 GB of
    RAM, with an exception of the last one:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Mid 2007 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Aluminum, Late 2008 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Late 2008 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2007 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (Early 2008 or later)</li>
    <li>Xserve (Early 2009)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Of these computers, the following models were equipped with 1 GB RAM as the
    standard option on the base model when they were shipped originally. They
    can only run OS X El Capitan if they have at least 2 GB of RAM.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Mid 2007 - Early 2008)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Early 2009)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following computers support features such as Handoff, Instant Hotspot,
    AirDrop between Mac computers and iOS devices, as well as the new Metal API:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (Late 2013)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The upgrade varies in size depending upon which Apple Mac computer it is
    being installed on; in most scenarios, it will require about 6 GB of disk
    space.
  </p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">Features</summary>
  <p>
    OS X El Capitan includes features to improve the security, performance,
    design and usability of OS X. Compared to OS X Yosemite, Apple says that
    opening PDFs is four times faster, app switching and viewing messages in
    Mail is twice as fast and launching apps is 40% faster. The maximum amount
    of memory that could be allocated to the graphics processor has been
    increased from 1024 MB to 1536 MB on Macs with an Intel HD 4000 GPU. OS X El
    Capitan supports Metal, Apple's graphics API introduced in iOS 8 to speed up
    performance in games and professional applications. Apple's typeface San
    Francisco replaces Helvetica Neue as the system typeface. OS X El Capitan
    also adopts LibreSSL in replacement of OpenSSL used in previous versions.
  </p>
  <span class="level-two">Window management</span>
  <p>
    OS X El Capitan introduces new window management features such as creating a
    full-screen split screen limited to two app windows side by side in full
    screen by pressing the green button on left upper corner of the window or
    <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>âŒ˜ Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> keyboard shortcut, then
    snapping any supported other window to that full screen application. This
    feature is slightly similar to, although less extensive than, the
    snap-assist feature in Windows 7 (and later) and several Linux desktop
    environments, such as GNOME. OS X El Capitan improves Mission Control to
    incorporate this feature across multiple spaces. It also enables users to
    spot the pointer more easily by enlarging it by shaking the mouse or swiping
    a finger back and forth on the trackpad.
  </p>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">Applications</summary>
    <div>
      <span class="level-three">Messages and Mail</span>
      <p>
        OS X El Capitan adds multi-touch gestures to applications like Mail and
        Messages that allow a user to delete or mark emails or conversations by
        swiping a finger on a multi-touch device, such as a trackpad. OS X also
        analyzes the contents of individual emails in Mail and uses the gathered
        information in other applications, such as Calendar. For example, an
        invitation in Mail can automatically be added as a Calendar event.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="level-three">Maps</span>
      <p>
        Apple Maps in El Capitan shows public transit information similar to
        Maps in iOS 9. This feature was limited to a handful of cities upon
        launch: Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City,
        New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Shanghai, Toronto and
        Washington D.C.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
      <p>
        The Notes application receives an overhaul, similar to Notes in iOS 9.
        Both applications have more powerful text-processing capabilities, such
        as to-do lists (like in the Reminders application), inline webpage
        previews, photos and videos, digital sketches, map locations and other
        documents and media types. Notes replaces traditional IMAP-based syncing
        with iCloud, which offers better end-to-end encryption and faster
        syncing.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="level-three">Safari</span>
      <p>
        Safari in El Capitan lets users pin tabs for frequently accessed
        websites to the tab bar, similar to Firefox and Google Chrome. Users are
        able to quickly identify and mute tabs that play audio without having to
        search for individual tabs. Safari supports AirPlay video streaming to
        an Apple TV without the need to broadcast the entire webpage. Safari
        extensions are now hosted and signed by Apple as part of the updated
        Apple Developer program and they received native support for content
        blocking, allowing developers to block website components (such as
        advertisements) without JavaScript injection. The app also allows the
        user to customize the font and background of the Reader mode.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="level-three">Spotlight</span>
      <p>
        Spotlight is improved with more contextual information such as the
        weather, stocks, news and sports scores. It is also able to process
        queries in natural language. For example, users can type "Show me
        pictures that I took in Yosemite National Park in July 2014" and
        Spotlight will use that request to bring up the corresponding info. The
        app can now be resized and moved across the screen.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span class="level-three">Photos</span>
      <p>
        Photos introduced editing extensions, which allow Photos to use editing
        tools from other apps.
      </p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary class="level-two">System Integrity Protection</summary>
    <p>
      OS X El Capitan has a new security feature called System Integrity
      Protection (SIP, sometimes referred to as "rootless") that protects
      certain system processes, files and folders from being modified or
      tampered with by other processes even when executed by the root user or by
      a user with root privileges (sudo). Apple says that the root user can be a
      significant risk factor to the system's security, especially on systems
      with a single user account on which that user is also the administrator.
      System Integrity Protection is enabled by default, but can be disabled.
