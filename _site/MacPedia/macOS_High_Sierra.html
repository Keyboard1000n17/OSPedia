</p>
<p>
  macOS High Sierra (version 10.13) is the fourteenth major release of macOS,
  Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. macOS High
  Sierra was announced at the WWDC 2017 on June 5, 2017 and was released on
  September 25, 2017. The name "High Sierra" refers to the High Sierra region in
  California. Its name signified its goal to be a refinement of the previous
  macOS version, macOS Sierra, focused on performance improvements and technical
  updates rather than features. This makes it similar to previous macOS releases
  Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion and El Capitan. Among the apps with notable
  changes are Photos and Safari.

<p>
  macOS High Sierra is the final version of macOS to support the Unibody iMac
  and the Polycarbonate Unibody MacBook, as its successor, macOS Mojave, drops
  support for the late 2009 and final models. The Unibody iMac was an all-in-one
  desktop manufactured by Apple while the Polycarbonate Unibody MacBook refers
  to one of the designs of MacBook models produced from 2006 to 2012.
</p>
<details>
  <summary class="level-one">System Requirements</summary>
  <p>
    All Macs that supported macOS Sierra support macOS High Sierra. They include
    the following models:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>iMac (Late 2009 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook (Late 2009 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Air (Late 2010 or later)</li>
    <li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
    <li>Mac Mini (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017)</li>
    <li>Mac Pro (Mid 2010 or later)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    macOS High Sierra requires at least 2 GB of RAM and 20.12 GB of available
    disk space. It is also possible to install High Sierra on many older
    Macintosh computers that are no longer supported by Apple. However, it
    requires using a patch to modify the install image.

  <span class="level-two">System</span>
  <div class="div-level-two">
    <span class="level-three">Apple File System</span>
    <p>
      Apple File System (APFS) replaces HFS Plus as the default file system in
      macOS for the first time with High Sierra. It supports 64-bit inode
      numbers, is designed for flash memory, and is designed to speed up common
      tasks like duplicating a file and finding the size of a folder's contents.
      It also has built-in encryption, crash-safe protections, and simplified
      data backup on the go.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Metal 2</span>
    <p>
      Metal, Apple's low-level graphics API, has been updated to Metal 2. It
      includes virtual reality and machine-learning features, as well as support
      for external GPUs. The system's windowing system, Quartz Compositor,
      supports Metal 2.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Media</span>
    <p>
      macOS High Sierra adds support for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC),
      with hardware acceleration where available, as well as support for High
      Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF). Macs with the Intel Kaby Lake
      processor offer hardware support for Main 10 profile 10-bit hardware
      decoding, those with the Intel Skylake processor support Main profile
      8-bit hardware decoding, and those with AMD Radeon 400 series graphics
      also support full HEVC decoding. However, whenever an Intel IGP is
      present, the frameworks will only direct requests to Intel IGP. In
      addition, audio codecs FLAC and Opus are also supported, but not in
      iTunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      HEVC hardware acceleration requires a Mac with a sixth-generation Intel
      processor or newer (late 2015 27-inch iMac, mid 2017 21.5-inch iMac, early
      2016 MacBook, late 2016 MacBook Pro or iMac Pro).
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Other</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In High Sierra, kernel extensions ("kexts") require explicit approval by
        the user before being able to run.
      </li>
      <li>
        Certain UI elements, such as the Low Battery notification and App Store
        icon, were redesigned to either be based on the iOS 11 equivalents or
        match with the overall less detailed design used in all releases since
        Yosemite.
      </li>
      <li>
        The time service <code>ntpd</code> was replaced with timed for the time
        synchronization.
      </li>
      <li>The FTP and telnet command line programs were removed.</li>
      <li>
        Caching Server, File Sharing Server, and Time Machine Server, features
        that were previously part of macOS Server, are now provided as part of
        the OS.
      </li>
      <li>
        A new “now playing” widget has been added to the Notification Center,
        based on the music Lock Screen toggle in iOS 11.
      </li>
      <li>
        The screen can now be locked using the shortcut Cmd+Ctrl+Q. The ability
        to lock screen using a menu bar shortcut activated in Keychain Access
        preferences has now been removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        The 10.13.4 update added support for external graphics processors for
        Macs equipped with Thunderbolt 3 ports. The update discontinued support
        for external graphics processors in 2015 or older Macs, equipped with
        Thunderbolt 1 and 2 ports.
      </li>
      <li>
        Starting with 10.13.4, when a 32-bit app is opened, users get a one-time
        warning about its future incompatibility with the macOS operating
        system.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <span class="level-two">Applications</span>
  <div class="div-level-two">
    <span class="level-three">Final Cut Pro 7</span>
    <p>
      Apple announced the original Final Cut Studio suite of programs will not
      work on High Sierra. Media professionals that depend on any of those
      programs were advised to create a double boot drive to their computer.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Photos</span>
    <p>
      macOS High Sierra gives Photos an updated sidebar and new editing tools.
      Photos synchronizes tagged People with iOS 11.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Mail</span>
    <p>
      Mail has improved Spotlight search with Top Hits. Mail also uses 35% less
      storage space due to optimizations, and Mail's compose window can now be
      used in split-screen mode.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Safari</span>
    <p>
      macOS High Sierra includes Safari 11. Safari 11 has a new "Intelligent
      Tracking Prevention" feature that uses machine learning to block third
      parties from tracking the user's actions. Safari can also block auto
      playing videos from playing. The "Reader Mode" can be set to always-on.
      Safari 11 also supports WebAssembly. The last version of Safari that High
      Sierra supports is 13.1.2. This version has known security issues.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Notes</span>
    <p>
      The Notes app includes the ability to add tables to notes, and notes can
      be pinned to the top of the list. The version number was incremented to
      4.5.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Siri</span>
    <p>
      In High Sierra, Siri uses a more natural and expressive voice. It also
      uses machine learning to understand the user better. Siri synchronizes
      information across iOS and Mac devices so the Siri experience is the same
      regardless of the product being used.
    </p>
    <span class="level-three">Messages</span>
    <p>
      The release of macOS High Sierra 10.13.5 (and iOS 11.4) introduced support
      for Messages in iCloud. This feature allows messages to sync across all
      devices using the same iCloud account. When messages are deleted they are
      deleted on each device as well, and messages stored in the cloud do not
      take up local storage on the device anymore. In order to use the feature,
      the user has to enable two-factor authentication for their Apple ID.
    </p>
  </div>
  <span class="level-two">Problems</span>
  <p>
    macOS High Sierra 10.13.0 and 10.13.1 have a critical vulnerability that
    allowed an attacker to become a root user by entering "root" as a username,
    and not entering a password, when logging in. This was fixed in the Security
    Update 2017-001 for macOS High Sierra v10.13.1.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it was first launched, it was discovered that the WindowServer process
    had a memory leak, leading to much slower graphics performance and lagging
    animations, probably due to some last-minute changes in Metal 2. This was
    fixed in macOS 10.13.1.
  </p>
  <p>
    macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 had an error that caused DisplayLink to stop
    working for external monitors, allowing only one monitor to be extended.
    When using two external monitors, they could only be mirrored. Alban Rampon,
    the Senior Product Manager for DisplayLink, stated on December 24, 2018,
    that the company was working with Apple to resolve the issue.
