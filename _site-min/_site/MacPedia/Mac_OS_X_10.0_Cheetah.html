It was released on March 24, 2001, for a price of $129 after a public beta.<div id=info><img alt="Mac OS X 10.0 box art" src=/MacPedia/Images/Icons/Cheetah-icon.webp data-pagefind-meta="image[src], image_alt[alt]"><p>Developed by: Apple Computer<p>General availability: March 24, 2001 (version 10.0 build 4K78)<p>Last release: June 22, 2001 (version 10.0.4 build 4S10)<p>Preceded by: Mac OS 9<p>Succeeded by: Mac OS X 10.1 (codename Puma)<p>Kernel type: Hybrid (XNU)<p>Support status: Historical and no longer supported</div><p>Mac OS X was Apple's successor to the classic Mac OS. It was derived from NeXTSTEP and FreeBSD, and featured a new user interface called Aqua, as well as improved stability and security due to its new Unix foundations. It introduced the Quartz graphics rendering engine for hardware-accelerated animations. Many technologies were ported from the classic Mac OS, including Sherlock and the QuickTime framework. The core components of Mac OS X were open sourced as Darwin.<p>Boxed releases of Mac OS X 10.0 also included a copy of Mac OS 9.1, which can be installed alongside Mac OS X 10.0, through the means of dual booting (which meant that reboots are required for switching between the two OSes). This was important for compatibility reasons; while many Mac OS 9 applications could be run under Mac OS X in the Classic environment, some, such as applications that directly accessed hardware, could only run under Mac OS 9.<p>Six months after its release, Mac OS X 10.0 was succeeded by Mac OS X 10.1, code named Puma.<details><summary class=level-one>Features</summary><span class=level-two>New and updated features</span><ul><li>The features of the release include the Dock which was a new way of organizing one's Mac OS X applications on a user interface, and a change from the classic method of application launching in previous Mac OS systems.<li>It included Terminal, a terminal emulator that provides access to Mac OS X's Unix command-line interface; the classic Mac OS had previously had the distinction of being one of the few operating systems with no command line interface.<li>The new Mail email client included the ability to configure the software to receive all of a user's email accounts in one list, the ability to file emails into folders, the ability to search for emails, and the ability to automatically append signatures to outgoing emails.<li>The Address Book was a new application which had features including exporting and importing cards to and from vCard format, API to interface with other applications, change of address notifications, contact groups, auto-merge when importing vCards, customizable fields and categories, the automatic formatting of phone numbers.<li>TextEdit replaced the SimpleText application with new features.<li>PDF support was added; it allows the user to create PDFs from any application.<li>The OS introduced the new Aqua UI.<li>Several features of Mac OS 9 were ported to Mac OS X, including the Sherlock desktop and web search engine.</ul><span class=level-two>Removed features</span><ul><li>File-sharing client — The system can only use TCP/IP, not AppleTalk, to connect to servers sharing the Apple Filing Protocol. It cannot use SMB to connect to Windows or Samba servers.<li>File-sharing server — As a server, the system can share files using only the Apple Filing Protocol (over TCP/IP), HTTP, SSH, and FTP.<li>Optical media — Neither DVD playback nor burning CDs or DVDs is supported. However, audio CD burning was added in the Mac OS X 10.0.2 update, roughly two months after initial release.</ul></details><details><summary class=level-one>Architecture</summary><p>Mac OS X is built on Darwin, a Unix-like operating system derived from FreeBSD. Darwin includes a new kernel, XNU, derived from Mach and BSD, as a replacement for the Mac OS nanokernel used in classic Mac OS.<p>Unlike Mac OS 9, Mac OS X has protected memory and preemptive multitasking. This means that if an application's memory becomes corrupted due to a bug, the application will crash without the entire system crashing and needing to be rebooted.<p>Mac OS X also had support for OpenGL, AppleScript, and the Carbon and Cocoa APIs.</details><details><summary class=level-one>Release History</summary><table style=float:none;width:98%><tr><th class=top-left>Version<th class=top>Build<th class=top>Date<th class=top-right>Darwin version<tr><td class=left>10.0<td>4K78<td>March 24, 2001<td class=right>1.3<tr><td class=left>10.0.1<td>4L13<td>April 14, 2001<td class=right style=text-align:center>1.3.1<tr><td class=left>10.0.2<td>4P12<td>May 1, 2001<tr><td class=left>10.0.3<td>4P13<td>May 9, 2001<tr><td class=left rowspan=3>10.0.4<td>4Q12<td>June 21, 2001<tr><td>4R14<td>July 18, 2001<tr><td class=bottom>4S10<td class=bottom>August 20, 2001</table></details><details><summary class=level-one>User Interface</summary><figure class=UI-Screenshots><img alt="Mac OS X 10.0 screenshot" src=/MacPedia/Images/UI/Cheetah-UI.webp class=UI-Screenshots loading=lazy><figcaption>A screenshot of Mac OS X 10.0 showcasing the new Aqua user interface</figcaption></figure></details></main><div class=article-nav><a href=/MacPedia/ClassicMacOS.html class="prxt prev" rel=prev><div class=prxt><img alt="Classic Mac OS" src=./Images/Icons/System_Software.png><p>Classic Mac OS</div></a><a href=/MacPedia/Mac_OS_X_10.1_Puma.html class="prxt next" rel=next><div class=prxt><p>Mac OS X 10.1</p><img alt="Mac OS X 10.1" src=./Images/Icons/Puma-icon.webp></div></a></div><template><tr><td class="left version"><td class=build><td class=release-date><td class=darwin-version><td class="right release-notes"></template><script src=/MacPedia/tables.js></script><div class=pagefind-ui__blur></div><script src=/hamburger.js></script>
