For macOS 14, refer to macOS Sonoma.</i><p>macOS Mojave (pronounced mo-HAH-vee) is the fifteenth major release of macOS, Apple Inc.'s desktop operating system for Macintosh computers. macOS Mojave was announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 4, 2018, and was released to the public on September 24. The operating system's name refers to the Mojave Desert, continuing the use of California-themed names that began with OS X Mavericks. It succeeded macOS High Sierra and was followed by macOS Catalina. macOS Mojave is the last version of macOS that features the iTunes and Dashboard apps.<div id=info><img alt="macOS Mojave logo" src=/MacPedia/Images/Icons/Mojave-icon.webp data-pagefind-meta="image[src], image_alt[alt]"><p>Developed by: Apple Computer, Inc.<p>General availability: September 24, 2018 (version 10.14 build 18A391 - original Mac App Store release)<p>Last release: July 21, 2021 (version 10.14.6 build 18G9323 - final security update; scroll down and click on "Release History" for all builds)<p>Preceded by: macOS High Sierra (version 10.13)<p>Succeeded by: macOS Catalina (version 10.15)<p>Kernel type: Hybrid (XNU)<p>Support status: Unsupported as of October 2021. iTunes is no longer being updated, but is able to download driver updates to sync to newer devices. (iTunes is replaced by separate apps in macOS Catalina, including Music, TV, Podcasts, and Finder for syncing devices.)</div><p>macOS Mojave brings several iOS apps to the desktop operating system, including Apple News, Voice Memos, and Home. It also includes a more comprehensive "dark mode", is the final version of macOS to support 32-bit application software, is the last version of the macOS capable of being booted from an HFS+ partition without third-party patching, and is also the last version of macOS to support the iPhoto app, which had already been superseded in OS X Yosemite (10.10) by the newer Photos app.<p>macOS Mojave was well received and was supplemented by point releases after launch.<details><summary class=level-one>System requirements</summary><p>macOS Mojave requires a GPU that supports Metal, and the list of officially-compatible systems is more restrictive than the previous version, macOS High Sierra. Mojave drops support for various Macs released from late 2009 to 2011. Compatible models are the following Macintosh computers running OS X Mountain Lion or later:<ul><li>iMac (Late 2012 or later)<li>iMac Pro (2017)<li>MacBook (Early 2015 or later)<li>MacBook Air (Mid 2012 or later)<li>MacBook Pro (Mid 2012 or later)<li>Mac Mini (Late 2012 or later)<li>Mac Pro (2013, 2010-2012 supported with a Metal-capable graphics card)/li></ul><p>macOS Mojave requires at least 2 GB of RAM as well as 12.5 GB of available disk space to upgrade from OS X El Capitan, macOS Sierra, or macOS High Sierra, or 18.5 GB of disk space to upgrade from OS X Yosemite and earlier releases. Some features are not available on all compatible models. Mojave installations convert the installation volume to Apple File System (APFS), if the volume had not previously been converted from HFS+.</details><details><summary class=level-one>Features</summary><span class=level-two>System updates</span><p>macOS Mojave deprecates support for several legacy features of the OS. The graphics frameworks OpenGL and OpenCL are still supported by the operating system, but will no longer be maintained; developers are encouraged to use Apple's Metal library instead.<p>OpenGL is a cross-platform graphics framework designed to support a wide range of processors. Apple chose OpenGL in the late 1990s to build support for software graphics rendering into the Mac, after abandoning QuickDraw 3D. At the time, moving to OpenGL allowed Apple to take advantage of existing libraries that enabled hardware acceleration on a variety of different GPUs. As time went on, Apple has shifted its efforts towards building its hardware platforms for mobile and desktop use. Metal makes use of the homogenized hardware by abandoning the abstraction layer and running on the "bare metal". Metal reduces CPU load, shifting more tasks to the GPU. It reduces driver overhead and improves multithreading, allowing every CPU thread to send commands to the GPU.<p>macOS does not natively support Vulkan, the Khronos group's official successor to OpenGL. The MoltenVK library can be used as a bridge, translating most of the Vulkan 1.0 API into the Metal API.<p>Continuing the process started in macOS High Sierra (10.13), which issued warnings about compatibility with 32-bit applications, Mojave issues warnings when opening 32-bit apps that they will not be supported in future updates. In macOS Mojave 10.14, this alert appears once every 30 days when launching the app, as macOS 10.15 will not support 32-bit applications.<p>When Mojave is installed, it will convert solid-state drives (SSDs), hard disk drives (HDDs), and Fusion Drives, from HFS Plus to APFS. On Fusion Drives using APFS, files will be moved to the SSD based on the file's frequency of use and its SSD performance profile. APFS will also store all metadata for a Fusion Drive's file system on the SSD.<p>New data protections require applications to get permission from the user before using the Mac camera and microphone or accessing system data like user Mail history and Messages database.</p><span class=level-two>Removed features</span><ul><li>Mojave removes integrations with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Vimeo, and Flickr, which were added in OS X Mountain Lion and Mavericks.<li>Mojave also removes support for sub-pixel rendering of text. The feature was previously used on non-Retina displays to improve the appearance of text on screen.<li>The only supported Nvidia graphics cards are the Quadro K5000 and GeForce GTX 680 Mac Edition.</ul><span class=level-two>Applications</span><p>Mojave features changes to existing applications as well as new ones. Finder now has metadata preview accessed via View > Show Preview, and many other updates, including a Gallery View (replacing Cover Flow) that lets users browse through files visually. After a screenshot is taken, the image appears in the corner of the display, as with iOS. The screenshot software can now record video, choose where to save files, and be opened via <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>5</kbd>.<p>Safari's Tracking Prevention features now prevent social media "Like" or "Share" buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission. The browser also sends less information to web servers about the user's system, reducing the chance of being tracked based on system configuration. It can also automatically create, autofill, and store strong passwords when users create new online accounts; it also flags reused passwords so users can change them.<p>A new Screenshot app was added to macOS Mojave to replace the Grab app. Screenshot can capture a selected area, window or the entire screen as well as screen record a selected area or the entire display. The Screenshot app is located in the /Applications/Utilities/ folder, as was the Grab app. Screenshot can also be accessed by pressing <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>.<p>macOS 10.14.1, released on October 30, 2018, adds Group FaceTime, which lets users chat with up to 32 people at the same time, using video or audio from an iPhone, iPad or Mac, or audio from Apple Watch. Participants can join in mid-conversation.<p>The Mac App Store was rewritten from the ground up and features a new interface and editorial content, similar to the iOS App Store. A new 'Discover' tab highlights new and updated apps; Create, Work, Play and Develop tabs help users find apps for a specific project or purpose.<p>Four new apps (News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home) are ported to macOS Mojave from iOS, with Apple implementing a subset of UIKit on the desktop OS. Third-party developers would be able to port iOS applications to macOS in 2019.<p>With Home, Mac users can control their HomeKit-enabled accessories to do things like turn lights off and on or adjust thermostat settings. Voice Memos lets users record audio (e.g., personal notes, lectures, meetings, interviews, or song ideas), and access them from iPhone, iPad or Mac. Stocks delivers curated market news alongside a personalized watchlist, with quotes and charts.<p>A few security fixes were made.</details><details><summary class=level-one>Release History</summary><table><tr><th class=top-left>Version<th class=top>Build<th class=top>Date<th class=top>Darwin version<th class=top-right>Notes<tr><td class=left>10.14<td>18A391<td>September 24, 2018<td>18.0.0<td class=right>Original Mac App Store release<tr><td class=left rowspan=3>10.14.1<td>18B75<td rowspan=3>October 30, 2018<td>18.2.0<br><small>xnu-4903.221.2~2</small><td class=right>About the macOS Mojave 10.14.1 Update<tr><td>18B2107<td rowspan=2><td class=right rowspan=2>Added support for new Vega GPUs in MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.<tr><td>18B3094<tr><td class=left>10.14.2<td>18C54<td>December 5, 2018<td>18.2.0<br><small>xnu-4903.231.4~2</small><td class=right>About the macOS Mojave 10.14.2 Update<tr><td class=left rowspan=3>10.14.3<td>18D42<td rowspan=2>January 22, 2019<td rowspan=3>18.2.0<br><small>xnu-4903.241.1~4</small><td class=right rowspan=2>About the macOS Mojave 10.14.3 Update<tr><td>18D43<tr><td>18D109<td>February 7, 2019<td class=right>About the security content of macOS Mojave 10.14.3 Supplemental Update<tr><td class=left rowspan=2>10.14.4<td>18E226<td rowspan=2>March 25, 2019<td rowspan=2>18.5.0<br><small>xnu-4903.251.3~3</small><td class=right rowspan=2>About the macOS Mojave 10.14.4 Update<tr><td>18E227<tr><td class=left>10.14.5<td>18F132<td>May 13, 2019<td>18.6.0<br><small>xnu-4903.261.4~2</small><td class=right>About the macOS Mojave 10.14.5 Update<tr><td class=bottom-left rowspan=19>10.14.6<td>18G84<td>July 22, 2019<td rowspan=2>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.270.47~4</small><td class=right>About the macOS Mojave 10.14.6 Update<tr><td>18G87<td>August 1, 2019<td class=right>Fixed a "Wake from Sleep" issue where Mac computers would not wake from sleep properly.<tr><td>18G95<td>August 26, 2019<td rowspan=2>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.271.2~2</small><td class=right>Security updates and bug fixes<ul><li>Solved: MacBook Shuts Down During Sleep<li>Fixed: Performance degradation when processing large files.<li>Fixed: iLife apps (Pages, Keynote, Numbers, GarageBand, and iMovie) not updating.<li>Re-fixed a vulnerability that was accidentally left unpatched in a previous update, which could have led to hacking attempts</ul><tr><td>18G103<td>September 26, 2019<td class=right>Security Updates and Bug Fixes<tr><td>18G1012<td>October 29, 2019<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.12~4</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2019-001<tr><td>18G2022<td>December 10, 2019<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.19~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2019-002<tr><td>18G3020<td>January 28, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.25~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2020-001<tr><td>18G4032<td>March 24, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.28~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2020-002<tr><td>18G5033<td>May 25, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.35~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2020-003<tr><td>18G6020<td>July 15, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.43~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2020-004<tr><td>18G6032<td>September 24, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.44~1<br>Pulled 2020-09-30</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2020-005<tr><td>18G6032<td>October 1, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.44~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of macOS 10.14.6 Supplemental Update<tr><td>18G6042<td>November 12, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.44.0.2~1</small><td>About the security content of Security Update 2020-006<tr><td>18G7016<td>December 14, 2020<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.51~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2020-007<tr><td>18G8012<td>February 1, 2021<td rowspan=2>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.56~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2021-001<tr><td>18G8022<td>February 9, 2021<td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2021-002<tr><td>18G9028<td>April 26, 2021<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.65~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2021-003<tr><td>18G9216<td>May 24, 2021<td>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.68~1</small><td class=right>About the security content of Security Update 2021-004<tr><td class=bottom>18G9323<td class=bottom>July 21, 2021<td class=bottom>18.7.0<br><small>xnu-4903.278.70~1</small><td class=bottom-right>About the security content of Security Update 2021-005</table></details><details><summary class=level-one>User interface</summary><p>Mojave revamps Dark Mode. A light-on-dark color scheme, it initially affected only the dock, menu bar, and drop-down menus, while here, it darkens the entire user interface to make content stand out while the interface recedes. Users can choose dark or light mode when installing Mojave, or any time thereafter from System Preferences. All of the built-in apps support the revamp. App developers can implement the feature in their apps via a public API.<p>Stacks, a feature introduced in Mac OS X Leopard, now lets users group desktop files into groups based on file attributes such as file kind, date last opened, date modified, date created, name and tags. This is accessed via View > Use Stacks.<p>macOS Mojave features a new Dynamic Desktop that automatically changes specially made desktop backgrounds (two of which are included) to match the time of day.<p>The Dock has a space for recently used apps that have not previously been added to the Dock.<p>macOS update functionality has been moved back to System Preferences from the Mac App Store.
