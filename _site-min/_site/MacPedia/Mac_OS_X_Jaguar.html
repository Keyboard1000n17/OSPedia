It superseded Mac OS X 10.1 and preceded Mac OS X Panther. The operating system was released on August 23, 2002. It was available both for single-computer installations and in a "family pack" that allowed five installations on separate computers in one household. Jaguar was the first Mac OS X release to publicly use its code name in marketing and advertisements.<div id=info><img alt="Mac OS X Jaguar box art (Not my picture)" src=/MacPedia/Images/Icons/Jaguar-icon.webp data-pagefind-meta="image[src], image_alt[alt]" style=border-radius:10px><p>Developed by: Apple Computer, Inc.<p>General availability: August 23, 2002<p>Original retail release: August 24, 2002 (version 10.2 build 6C115 and 6C115a)<p>Last release: October 3, 2003 (version 10.2.8 build 6R73 and 6S90)<p>Preceded by: Mac OS X 10.1 (codename Puma)<p>Succeeded by: Mac OS X Panther<p>Kernel type: Hybrid (XNU)<p>Support status: Historical, unsupported as of January 1, 2007</div><details><summary class=level-one>System Requirements</summary><p>Mac OS X Jaguar requires a PowerPC G3 or G4 CPU and 128 MB of RAM. Special builds were released for the first PowerPC G5 systems released by Apple.</details><details><summary class=level-one>New and changed features</summary><p>Jaguar introduced many new features to Mac OS X, which are still supported to this day, including MPEG-4 support in QuickTime, Address Book, and Inkwell for handwriting recognition. It also included the first release of Apple's Zeroconf implementation, Rendezvous (later renamed to Bonjour), which allows devices on the same network to automatically discover each other and offer available services, such as file sharing, shared scanners, and printers, to the user.<p>Mac OS X Jaguar Server 10.2.2 added journaling to HFS Plus, the native Macintosh file system, to add increased reliability and data recovery features. This was later added to the standard Mac OS X in version 10.3 Panther.<p>Jaguar saw the debut of Quartz Extreme, a technology used to composite graphics directly on the video card, without the use of software to composite windows. The technology allotted the task of drawing the 3D surface of windows to the video card, rather than to the CPU, to increase interface responsiveness and performance.<p>Universal Access was added to allow the Macintosh to be usable by disabled computer users.<p>The user interface of Jaguar was also updated to add search features to the Finder, powered by Sherlock 3.<p>Internally, Jaguar also added the Common Unix Printing System (also known as CUPS), a modular printing system for Unix-like operating systems, and improved support for Microsoft Windows networks using the open-source Samba as a server for the SMB remote file access protocol and a FreeBSD-derived virtual file system module as a client for SMB.<p>The Happy Mac startup icon that was introduced with the original Macintosh was replaced with a grey Apple logo. The gray startup screen was used up until OS X Yosemite.</details><details><summary class=level-one>Release History</summary><table width=98%><tr><th class=top-left>Version<th class=top>Build<th class=top>Date<th class=top>Darwin Version<th class=top-right>Notes<tr><td class=left rowspan=2>10.2<td>6C115<td rowspan=2>August 24, 2002<td rowspan=2>6.0<td class=right rowspan=2>Original retail release<tr><td>6C115a<tr><td class=left>10.2.1<td>6D52<td>September 18, 2002<td>6.1<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.1 Update, codename Jaguar Red<tr><td class=left>10.2.2<td>6F21<td>November 11, 2002<td>6.2<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.2 Update, codename Jaguar Blue or Merlot<tr><td class=left rowspan=3>10.2.3<td>6G30<td>December 19, 2002<td rowspan=3>6.3<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.3 Update, codename Jaguar Green<tr><td>6G37<td><td class=right>Updated retail release<tr><td>6G50<td><td class=right>Server edition; retail release<tr><td class=left>10.2.4<td>6I32<td>February 13, 2003<td>6.4<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.4 Update, codename Jaguar Pink<tr><td class=left>10.2.5<td>6L29<td>April 10, 2003<td>6.5<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.5 Update, codename Jaguar Plaid<tr><td class=left>10.2.6<td>6L60<td>May 6, 2003<td>6.6<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.6 Update, codename Jaguar Black<tr><td class=left>10.2.7<td>6R65<td>September 22, 2003<td>6.7<td class=right>Removed from distribution due to defects<tr><td class=bottom-left rowspan=2>10.2.8<td>6R73<td class=bottom rowspan=2>October 3, 2003<td class=bottom rowspan=2>6.8<td class=right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.8 Update; released as 6R50 for one day<tr><td class=bottom>6S90<td class=bottom-right>About the Mac OS X 10.2.8 (G5) Update</table></details><details><summary class=level-one>User Interface</summary><figure class=UI-Screenshots><img alt="Mac OS X Jaguar screenshot" src=/MacPedia/Images/UI/Jaguar-UI.webp class=UI-Screenshots loading=lazy><figcaption>A screenshot of Mac OS X Jaguar showing the Desktop and the Apple menu open.</figcaption></figure></details></main><div class=article-nav><a href=/MacPedia/Mac_OS_X_10.1_Puma.html class="prxt prev" rel=prev><div class=prxt><img alt="Mac OS X 10.1" src=./Images/Icons/Puma-icon.webp><p>Mac OS X 10.1</div></a><a href=/MacPedia/Mac_OS_X_Panther.html class="prxt next" rel=next><div class=prxt><p>Mac OS X Panther</p><img alt="Mac OS X Panther" src=./Images/Icons/Panther-icon.webp></div></a></div><template><tr><td class="left version"><td class=build><td class=release-date><td class=darwin-version><td class="right release-notes"></template><script src=/MacPedia/tables.js></script><div class=pagefind-ui__blur></div><script src=/hamburger.js></script>
